Applying ice is recommended for 15 to 20 minutes every two to three hours for the first 48 hours or until swelling is improved. You can use a sealed bag of ice, chemical ice pack, frozen peas, frozen meat, or any other cold object. If you leave ice on 1 location for more than 30 minutes, you risk longterm damage to your body part. Putting a towel between your skin and the ice can make it more comfortable, but will decrease the benefits of icing. The smaller the window of time is between onset of soreness and application of ice, the sooner the soreness will be alleviated. Use a compressive device such as an elastic bandage to limit swelling and inflammation. Elevate the ankle above the heart to increase blood and lymphatic drainage back to the heart.[4] X Expert Source Catherine Cheung, DPMBoard Certified Podiatrist Expert Interview. 21 April 2020.

How to Field a Ground Ball: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Be ready to move if the ball comes toward you.,"Be ready to move if the ball comes toward you. You'll only have a few seconds to react once the ball is hit, so you've got to be able to reflexively move toward the ball if its yours to field. Some fielders find it helpful to sway from side to side a bit as they wait for the hit. Shifting your weight back and forth can help you feel ready to spring toward the ball quickly."
How to Field a Ground Ball: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Move in front of the ball.,"Move in front of the ball. When the ball is hit, run as fast as you can to get in front of it. The angle at which you run is dependent on how fast the ball is moving.[1] X Research source Here are a few different scenarios: If it's a slow moving ball, you might want to charge it. This means running toward the ball at an angle that will help you reach it as quickly as possible. If the ball is hit hard and low, it will respond violently to imperfections on the ground. Reaching the ball as quickly as possible is a good way to prevent it from bouncing away from you or at you in a harmful, unexpected way. If it's a very fast moving ball, it's more important to run at an angle that will give you time to field the ball with ease, rather than having to dive or stretch your glove at an odd angle. Instead of running toward the ball, run to one side or the other so you can get in position to have the ball coming right at your glove. With practice, you'll be able to discern what approach is right for what grounder speed. Timing is everything when it comes to fielding grounders."
How to Field a Ground Ball: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Decide to field it on a long hop or a short hop.,"Decide to field it on a long hop or a short hop. Grounders can be difficult to field because each hop they take can make them bounce in an unpredictable direction. Your best bet is to try to field a grounder on as long a hop as possible, because you'll know just where to position your glove to catch it. Fielding a grounder on a short hop is more difficult, because you have less time to react to the ball's bounce. If you let it bounce right in front of your glove, it could easily hop over your shoulder or to your left or right, forcing you to fumble.[2] X Research source Try to time your fielding so that the ball won't hop right in front of your glove. Catch it after it has hopped several feet away, so you have time to move toward it and catch it. If the ball does hop right in front of you, you'll need to have very quick reflexes to catch it. Keep your body in front of the ball. If it skips off your glove, you might be able to stop it with your foot or another body part - anything to keep it from getting past you!"
How to Field a Ground Ball: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Angle your body to field it more easily.,"Angle your body to field it more easily. It's most comfortable to field the ball on the same side of your body as your glove hand. If your right hand is your glove hand, try to position yourself so that the ball is moving slightly toward your right side. If your left hand is your glove hand, position yourself so you can catch it on that side. You should still be fairly square with the ball, however. Try to not to put yourself in the position of needing to dive or stretch your arm to catch it. If the ball is traveling extremely fast, you won't always have time to get in the ideal fielding position. You may need to dive, stretch, or backhand it to make the catch."
How to Field a Ground Ball: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Bend your knees and drop your behind to the ground.,"Bend your knees and drop your behind to the ground. When the ball is high, it's time to get low. If you don't, you stand a very good chance of having it fly between your legs - the most embarrassing fielder's error.

How to Field a Ground Ball: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Extend your glove in front of you.,"Extend your glove in front of you. Here's where hand-eye coordination comes into play. Extend your glove toward the ball, keeping your elbow slightly bent. Position your glove so that the ball will roll or hop right into it.

When the ball is secure, immediately transfer it to your throwing hand. If you used your throwing hand to trap the ball, you can simply grasp the ball using the right grip to quickly throw it. If you fielded the ball with your glove stretched to one side or if you caught it backhanded, bring your glove to your throwing hand and grab the ball.[6] X Research source Practice getting a good grip on the ball. Without looking, practice quickly gripping the ball by the seams. Developing this reflex means your throw will more likely be on-target and easy to catch. The ball transfer should be done deliberately and quickly. There's still room for fumbling after you've successfully fielded the ball, so the transfer needs to be practiced just as much. Work on your ball transfer. Practice transferring your ball from your glove to your throwing hand. In the dugout when there's nothing to do, or anytime you have a ball handy, practice."
How to Field a Ground Ball: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Rise and move to adjust your footing.,"Rise and move to adjust your footing. Now it's time to quickly get in position to throw the ball.

Get out of the vehicle carefully and walk back over to the power steering reservoir. Open the cap on your reservoir and check the power steering fluid to see if it is lower than it was when you first checked it. If it is low, fill the power steering reservoir up with more power steering fluid so that the liquid reaches the cold fill line on the dipstick.[13] X Research source The power steering fluid levels typically go down when you remove the air. The excess air sits in the power steering lines and pushes the fluid up to make it seem like there is more fluid in the power steering lines than there actually is. Removing this air will cause the fluid levels to drop back down. You may hear a small popping sound when you open the cap. This is because all of the air was forced to the top of the reservoir when you were turning lock to lock."

How to Train a Naughty Labrador: 14 Steps (with Pictures),Note that there is no such thing as a 'naughty' Labrador.,"Note that there is no such thing as a 'naughty' Labrador. The concept of 'naughtiness' is a human characterization that has been incorrectly applied to an animal. Your Labrador is not innately ""naughty"" or ""bad."" Rather, your dog does what Labradors do in a Labrador fashion until you teach him new behaviors. Keep in mind that he wasn't born automatically knowing the rules of living in a human world.[2] X Research source"
How to Train a Naughty Labrador: 14 Steps (with Pictures),Read up on the breed.,"Read up on the breed. Labradors are generally intelligent, happy, and energetic dogs. They need substantial attention and an outlet for their energy. Labradors originated from and were developed in Newfoundland. They were frequently used by fishermen to help retrieve fishing nets and loose fish. To this day, they remain good ""workers"" and swimmers. The versatility of the Labrador has seen the breed utilized in many ""jobs,"" including search and rescue, police work, drug detection, and service work for the blind, among others.[3] X Research source"
How to Train a Naughty Labrador: 14 Steps (with Pictures),Treat Labradors in a manner that befits their breed.,"Treat Labradors in a manner that befits their breed. Giving them what they need will help ensure that they don't engage in ""bad behaviors"" as a way to cope with the insufficiency of their treatment. For example, Labradors need to play and be thoroughly walked. If you don't do this, they often become bored and destructive. Keep them active by playing fetch and going on substantial walks at least twice a day. Increased physical activity helps a dog stay healthy and also tires them out. A tired out Labrador will, in turn, be less inclined to help himself to the food in your cupboards and dig up your garden. Swimming is also excellent exercise for a dog and playing fetch in the water is a great combination that expends a lot of dog energy."
How to Train a Naughty Labrador: 14 Steps (with Pictures),Be precise and direct.,"Be precise and direct. Don't lecture your Labrador. Your commands need to be simple and consistent. ""No"", ""Drop"", ""Wait"" are strong, simple, and direct. ""Stop doing that, oh for goodness sake"" or ""Oi, stop eating my shoe"" will not work as they are too complicated. Remember that dogs don't process language like humans do."
How to Train a Naughty Labrador: 14 Steps (with Pictures),Be firm and in control.,"Be firm and in control. In general, shouting at any dog is ineffective. This is especially true for Labradors who are an excitable breed by nature. Use a firm voice when instructing your dog; don't yell or lose control. Dogs are very intuitive and will be able to sense your frustration and may react in kind. Firm and assertive commands will communicate to the Labrador what you want him to do."
How to Train a Naughty Labrador: 14 Steps (with Pictures),Be timely in your responses and commands.,"Be timely in your responses and commands. Admonishing a Labrador too long after the incident is ineffective. If you need to admonish or correct your dog, it needs to be done during or within a few seconds of the act. Dogs will have forgotten the event within seconds of its occurrence, so it's key to address the behavior immediately in order to facilitate the retraining process."
How to Train a Naughty Labrador: 14 Steps (with Pictures),Coach the family.,"Coach the family. If you live in a household of more than one, your family also needs training. Explain to your family as well as visitors to your home about what your dog is and is not allowed to do. For example, if you do not allow anyone to feed your Labrador at the dinner table, then you need to let others know about that rule. If other family members or visitors don't know about this rule, they may feed your dog, which is confusing for him and will disrupt the training you have done."

How to Train a Naughty Labrador: 14 Steps (with Pictures),Reward the behavior you wish to encourage.,"Reward the behavior you wish to encourage. It is easy to apply human morality and motivation to your Labrador. But the fact of the matter is that your Labrador is not human and 'just is' and 'just does'. For example, eating the sleeve of your best work shirt is not a conscious act on behalf of your dog to upset you. Oftentimes, the shirt was just there and it was chewable.[5] X Research source Rewarding good behavior is more effective than punishing bad behavior. Instead of becoming exasperated with and angry at your Labrador for chewing your shirt, encourage him to chew his play toy and reward him with praise for doing so."
How to Train a Naughty Labrador: 14 Steps (with Pictures),Try clicker training.,"Try clicker training. Clicker training facilitates the immediate delivery of positive reinforcement. Labradors are highly trainable because they are so food motivated and this makes clicker training ideal for them.[6] X Research source Clicker training uses a sounda clickto tell the dog when he has done something right. The clicker itself is a tiny plastic box held in the palm of your hand. It has a metal tongue that you push to instantly make the sound. The method works by teaching the dog that every time he hears the clicking sound, he gets a treat. Eventually the dog will come to learn that clicks are always followed by treats and this is a very powerful incentive for Labradors. Once your dog makes this connection, you can use the clicker to instantly reward the Labrador for performing the right behavior (such as sitting down). Over time, he will learn that sitting down when ""on command"" gets him rewards.[7] X Trustworthy Source American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty Go to source Learn how to clicker train your dog."
How to Train a Naughty Labrador: 14 Steps (with Pictures),Appeal to your Labrador's belly.,"Appeal to your Labrador's belly. Most dogs are constantly hungry. Labradors in particular are food-oriented and motivated. Reward desirable behavior with food and youre likely to get a repeat of that good behavior. For example, if your Labrador is gnawing through your settee, encourage him to pick up his play toy and then reward him with a treat and make a great fuss of him. The treats can gradually give way to praise and, over time, your Labrador will learn not to chew on your settee. Treats should be small, such as Mini Zukes, Charlie Bears, Bil Jac, or freeze-dried liver. Cooked kidney is a cheap alternative to buying dog treats and is also very easy to prepare and cut up. Many dogs will even work for their regular dog kibble. Giving treats as a reward for the behavior you wish to encourage should be used only as a starting measure. Treats should soon be replaced with praise as the reward, otherwise the dog may become overweight or even obese. Some trainers recommend having a dog with attention problems have to earn every kibble in his bowl, instead of being fed large meals at one time. That way, your dog is very focused on you and the food, making it easier to convey the message that he needs to learn to earn.[8] X Research source"
How to Train a Naughty Labrador: 14 Steps (with Pictures),Employ distraction techniques.,"Employ distraction techniques. For instance, if your Labrador has taken to either launching himself at passers by or other dogs or barking at people and other dogs, then you should try to distract him. You need to temporarily interrupt your Labrador's stream of thought by talking to or commanding him or by an action (such as stomping your foot). Prepare ahead of the actual distraction by working on distraction techniques with treats in low distraction settings and at home. Make sure you follow through with praise and treats. As you get more confident where it is quiet, increase the level of difficulty by walking around the block or near a dog park to work on his skills. Gradually work up to busier areas once your Labrador is consistently responding to commands like leave it or watch me. Work up slowly to added distraction and you will both gain confidence in your Labrador's ability to handle a crowd."

You will never make a good player if suddenly you move from prop to center. Each position has its own requirements and needs, and you won't become a better player if you switch positions just as you're learning one of them well. You should, however, have a basic understanding of each of your teammate's positions. Rugby is a fluid, fast game, and you can best support your teammates if you know what they're trying to do.

Do not try to be a hero, just play the game and do what your position is designed to do. There are 30 players on the field at any time in a game of rugby -- making it nearly impossible for one player to try and win the game on their own. Successful rugby teams are filled with players who know their role and stick to it. Each position is designed to compliment the others. If you decide you want to start rucking as a scrum-half, you may win a few more lose balls. Your fly-half, however, will lose the connection that gets him the ball, effectively destroying your offense. Everyone will leave position occasionally for a tackle or run.

In rugby, any team can grab possession at almost any time, and offense switches to defense on the fly. This makes it much more crucial to hold onto the ball, tiring the other team on defense until a good scoring opportunity arises. While all good teams take occasional risks, the majority of their efforts are spent keeping the ball. If you don't have any support, slow down and wait for it. You can keep the ball in the ruck a little longer while your team catches up, or skip out on a risky run up the sideline until you have someone to pass to or ruck for you. Only make passes you know will connect. If you don't have a good pass, simply go into contact, let your teammates ruck, and reset.

Similarly, if you've already lost or almost lost a ruck, get out of there and defend the rest of the field. If you see a teammate get tackled there are more defenders than teammates, get over quickly in order to defend possession. If you're near a stalemating ruck, throw yourself in to turn the tide.

The biggest hurdle for most beginner rugby players isn't a skill, idea, or trick -- it's confidence. While confidence factors into all sports, in rugby the knowledge that you can take a hit (or hit an opponent) and be okay is not something everyone is born with. It takes time to get used to the physicality of rugby. However, the ability to give it your all, and not to slow down or loosen up before contact, will actually make you safer in the long run. Gain confidence by tacking hits in practice. Start at 50% speed, or by tackling from your knees, and gradually work up to full contact. Think of going through an opponent, not at him. Keep your feet moving at all times to drive through tackles and rucks with ease. Mentally prepare yourself for games and hits.

Rugby is much more fluid than football, so you don't want to keep the ball locked up under your arm like a running back. Instead, you need to adapt your hold depending on the situation: General Play: Hold the ball with your fingertips right near the center of your chest, with the point facing up. This allows you to quickly pass , fake or kick in any direction. Under Pressure / Being Tackled: Grip the ball horizontally with both hands and forearms. Your left forearm is on the top of the ball, your left hand gripping the right end, and your right forearm is on the bottom of the ball, with your right hand gripping the left point.

With all the focus on ""huge hits"" and the best tackling form, many players forget how often they are the ones getting hit. Learning to take a tackle well helps your team win more rucks, helps you gain ground on a defender, and protects you from injuries. Turn the ball away from the defender. As you approach, pick a side to run at and turn the ball away, lowering your shoulder slightly towards the opponent. Keep moving your feet forward. This might seem terrifying, but you want your momentum running through him, not the other way around. The player that eases up or slows down is almost always the one who gets hurt. Fall ""in order."" You should hit the ground first with your knees, then hips, then shoulders to distribute your weight when you fall. Place the ball back towards your team. You have 1-2 seconds after going down to place the ball, so do your team a solid and reach back.

3 Ways to Become a Better Rugby Player - wikiHow,Execute perfect offloads as you take tackles.,"Execute perfect offloads as you take tackles. The offload is when you pop the ball up to teammate as you're going down, allowing them to dodge your tackler and keep running. Most beginners are told not to offload, and for good reason: it is very easy to make a terrible pass while you're being pulled violently to the ground. However, as you get better you'll notice how often the pros offload, keeping a run alive and slowly chipping past the defense. To perfect the offload-- Ensure that your teammate is ready for the ball my making eye contact with them. Do not spin the ball, it is too difficult under pressure. Instead, use a short, quick 1-3 yard ""pop"" to toss the ball to them. If you're in doubt, go into contact. If you don't think you can pull the pass off, or if a 2nd defender is coming in, just take the tackle. Remember-- possession is more important than on good run.[5] X Research source"

Backs: Should focus on sprint training, being able to run near top speed even towards the ends of games. Strength training is imperative, but not so much that you lose speed and mobility. Forwards: Need to focus on strength and mass. Bigger people make a bigger impact in the scrum and on rucks, and are harder to take down or get through.

Sprint that try-line too, and repeat 5x. Rest and do it once more. Add an extra lap each day you train, or add the half-field or 22-meter lines into the mix. Run at 80% top speed for 30 seconds, then jog for a minute. Repeat 10 times. As you get better, decrease your jogging time until you are at only 30 seconds.

How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Keep a thought journal.,"Keep a thought journal. Keeping a journal is important so that you can note when these negative thoughts show up, under what circumstances, and how you react to them in the moment. Often, we have become so accustomed to our negative thoughts that they've become ""automatic,"" or habitual reflexes. Taking a moment to record the thought in your journal will begin to give you the distance you need to change these thoughts.[2] X Trustworthy Source University of Rochester Medical Center Leading academic medical center in the U.S. focused on clinical care and research Go to source When you have a negative thought, write down what the thought was. Also note down what was happening when the thought occurred. What were you doing? Who were you with? Where were you? Had anything happened that might have triggered this thought? Note your responses in the moment. What did you do, think, or say in response to this thought? Take a little time to reflect on these. Ask yourself how strongly you believe these thoughts about yourself, and how you feel when you experience them."
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Note when you are negative toward yourself.,"Note when you are negative toward yourself. Negative thoughts can be about others, but frequently, they're about us. Negative beliefs about ourselves can manifest in negative self-evaluations. These self-evaluations can look like ""should"" statements, such as ""I should be better at this."" They can also look like negative labeling, such as ""I'm a loser"" or ""I'm pathetic."" Negative generalizations are also common, such as ""I'm always ruining everything."" These thoughts suggest that you have internalized negative beliefs about yourself and accept them as fact.[3] X Research source Take note in your journal when you experience thoughts like this. When you write them down, try to give yourself a little space between yourself and the thought. Write down ""I had the thought that I was a loser,"" rather than just repeat ""I'm a loser."" This will help you come to realize that these thoughts aren't facts."
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Identify some problem behaviors.,"Identify some problem behaviors. Negative thoughts, especially about ourselves, usually result in negative behaviors. As you record your thoughts, pay attention to the behaviors that you use to respond to them. Some common unhelpful behaviors include: Withdrawing from loved ones, friends, and social situations Overcompensating (e.g., going to extremes to make everyone else happy because you want them to accept you) Neglecting things (e.g., not studying for a test because you believe you are ""stupid"" and will fail anyway) Being passive rather than assertive (e.g., not voicing your true thoughts and feelings in a clear way)"
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Examine your journal.,"Examine your journal. Look for patterns in your negative thoughts that reveal core beliefs. For example, if you frequently see thoughts such as ""I should do better at tests"" or ""Everyone thinks I'm a loser,"" you may have internalized a negative core belief about your ability to perform, such as ""I'm stupid."" You are allowing yourself to think in rigid, unreasonable ways about yourself. These negative core beliefs can cause a lot of damage. Because they run so deeply, it's important to understand them, rather than just focus on changing the negative thoughts themselves. Just focusing on changing negative thoughts is a bit like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound: it will not address what's at the root of the problem. For example, if you have a core negative belief that you are ""worthless,"" you will likely experience a lot of negative thoughts related to that belief, such as ""I am pathetic,"" ""I don't deserve anyone to love me,"" or ""I should be a better person."" You will also probably see negative behaviors related to this belief, such as bending over backwards to please a friend because deep down, you believe you're not worthy of having friendship. You need to challenge the belief to change the thoughts and behaviors."
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Ask yourself some hard questions.,"Ask yourself some hard questions. Once you've been keeping track of your thoughts in your journal for a bit, take some time to ask yourself what unhelpful rules, assumptions, and patterns you can identify in your thinking. Ask yourself questions such as: What are my standards for myself? What do I find acceptable and unacceptable? Are my standards for myself different than my standards for others? How? What do I expect of myself in various situations? For example, how do I expect myself to be when I'm at school, work, socializing, having fun, etc? When do I feel the most anxious or self-doubting? In what situations am I hardest on myself? When do I expect negativity? What did my family tell me about standards and what I should and shouldn't do? Do I feel anxiety in some situations more than others?"
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Be deliberate with your thoughts and beliefs.,"Be deliberate with your thoughts and beliefs. Make the decision that you are going to play an active role in determine your own thoughts. You can control what you think about. This means making a daily effort to consciously program thoughts or affirmations into your mind as well as learning to be mindful and more present. Remember that you are a special, one-of-a-kind person that deserves love and respect - from others and from yourself. The first step to getting rid of negative thoughts is making a commitment to doing so.[4] X Research source It is often helpful to choose a particular thought or unhelpful ""rule"" that you want to focus on changing, rather than trying to completely eradicate all negative thinking overnight. For example, you could select negative thoughts about whether you deserve love and friendship to start with."
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Remind yourself that thoughts are merely thoughts.,"Remind yourself that thoughts are merely thoughts. Those negative thoughts you encounter are not facts. They are the product of negative core beliefs that you've adopted over the course of your life. Reminding yourself that your thoughts are not facts, and that your thoughts don't define you, will help you distance yourself from unhelpful negative thinking. For example, instead of saying I'm stupid, say, I'm having a thought that is stupid. Instead of saying, I'm going to flunk the exam say I'm thinking I'm going to fail this test. The difference is subtle but important in re-training your consciousness and eradicating negative thinking."
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Find the triggers of your negative thoughts.,"Find the triggers of your negative thoughts. Knowing exactly why we have negative thoughts is hard to pinpoint, but there are several hypotheses about why this happens. According to some researchers, negative thoughts are a byproduct of evolution in which we are constantly scanning our environment for clues about danger or looking for places of improvement or things to fix. Sometimes negative thoughts are brought on by anxiety or worry, in which you are thinking about all that could go wrong or could be dangerous, humiliating, or anxiety-provoking. Additionally, negative thinking or pessimism can be learned from your parents or family when you were young. Negative thinking is also associated with depression and it is thought that negative thinking progresses depression and depression spurs on negative thinking in a cyclical fashion.[5] X Research source Lastly, negative thinking can stem from past traumas or experiences that cause you to feel shame and doubt. Think about any troubling conditions or situations that might be related to why you feel badly about yourself. For many people, typical triggers may include work meetings, school presentations, interpersonal problems at work or home, and significant life changes, such as leaving home, changing jobs, or separating from a partner. Keeping your journal will help you identify these triggers."
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Be aware of the different types of negative thoughts.,"Be aware of the different types of negative thoughts. For a lot of us, negative thoughts and beliefs can become so normal that we just assume them to be accurate reflections of reality. Try to be aware of some key patterns of thinking that be harmful; this can help you better understand your behaviour. Here are some common types of negative thinking that therapists term cognitive distortions:[6] X Research source All-or-nothing or binary thinking Mental filtering Jumping to negative conclusions Turning positives into negatives Emotional reasoning Negative self-talk Overgeneralization"
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Try informal Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.,"Try informal Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, is an effective method of changing your thoughts. To begin changing your negative thoughts, you have to take notice of your thoughts as they happen. Catch yourself thinking negatively and stop to see which of the types of negative thinking it is. You can even write it down in a journal the moment you are first learning to alter your thought to gain some clarity on the process.[7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Once youve identified the type(s) of negative thinking at work, begin to test the reality of the thought. You can look for evidence to the contrary. For example, if you think, ""I always mess things up"", think about three instances where you did something successfully. Also be aware of the things that you do successfully as you practice CBT, as an evidence against the limiting thoughts. You can also experiment with the thought to see if it true. For example, if you think, ""Im going to pass out if I try to give a speech in front of people"", experiment with this thought by staging a mock speech in front of others to prove to yourself that you will not pass out. You can also try a survey to test thoughts. Ask others about the thought you had to see if their interpretation is the same as yours. You can also try replacing certain words that make the statement negative. For example, if you say ""I should not have done that to my friend you could say ""Things would have turned out better if I had not done that to my friend"" or ""Im sad I did that to my friend, and I will try not to repeat it in the future."" Overtime, these CBT-based exercises can help you adjust your thoughts to be more realistic, positive, and proactive, rather than negative and self-defeating."
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Attack all-or-nothing thinking.,"Attack all-or-nothing thinking. This type of thought occurs when you perceive that life and everything you do only has two paths. Things are either good or bad, positive or negative, etc. You do not allow room for flexibility or re-interpretation.[8] X Research source For example, if you don't get a promotion but are specifically encouraged to apply the next time there's an opening, you might still insist that you're a total failure and worthless because you didn't get the job. You see things as either all good or all bad and there is nothing in between. To challenge this type of thinking, ask yourself to think about situations along a scale from 0-10. Remember that things are extremely unlikely to be a 0 or a 10.[9] X Research source For example, you might tell yourself, My work experience for this promotion was about a 6 of 10. That suggests I wasnt a good fit for this position. That doesnt mean I wont be a good fit for another position."
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Fight filtering.,"Fight filtering. When you filter, you see only the negative side of things and filter out everything else. This usually results in distortions of individuals and situations. You may even blow negatives way out of proportion.[10] X Research source For example, if your boss noted that you made a typo on a report, you might focus on this and ignore all the good things she said about your work. Instead, focus on potentially negative situations, such as criticism, as opportunities for growth rather than attacks. You could tell yourself, My boss really liked my work, and the fact that she told me about the typo shows that she respects my ability to correct mistakes. Thats a strength. I also know to proofread more carefully next time.[11] X Research source You can also try to find one positive thing for each negative thing you notice. This will require you to broaden your focus. You may also notice yourself diminishing positives, such as saying I just got lucky or That only happened because my boss/teacher likes me. This is also inaccurate thinking. When you work really hard for something, acknowledge your effort."
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Try not to jump to conclusions.,"Try not to jump to conclusions. When you jump to conclusions, you assume the worst when there is almost no evidence to support that contention. You havent asked the other person for information or clarification. Youve just made an assumption and run with it.[12] X Research source For example, ""My friend didn't respond to the invite I just sent a half hour ago so she must hate me."" Ask yourself what evidence you have for this assumption. Require yourself to compile a list of evidence in support of the assumption, just like you were a detective. What do you actually know about the situation? What do you still need to make an informed judgment?[13] X Research source"
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Watch out for emotional reasoning.,"Watch out for emotional reasoning. You infer that how you feel is reflective of a larger fact. You accept your thoughts as true and correct without asking questions of them.[14] X Research source For example, ""I feel like a total failure, so I must be a total failure."" Instead, ask yourself for other evidence about this feeling. What do other people think of you? What does your performance at school or work suggest? What evidence can you find to support or discredit this feeling? Remember that thoughts are not facts, even when they feel true."
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Overcome overgeneralization.,"Overcome overgeneralization. When you overgeneralize, you assume that one bad experience automatically ensures more bad experiences in the future. You base your assumptions on limited evidence and use words like always or never.[15] X Research source For example, if a first date doesnt go as you hoped, you might think, Im never going to find someone to love. Eliminate those words such as always or never. Use limited language instead, such as This particular date didnt work out. Look for evidence to challenge this thought. For example, does one date really determine the rest of your love life? What is the actual likelihood of that?"
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,"Acknowledge all thoughts, including the negative ones.","Acknowledge all thoughts, including the negative ones. Negative thoughts are just like any other thoughts. They come into your head. They exist. Acknowledging your unhelpful thoughts doesnt mean accepting that theyre right or true. It means noticing when you experience an unhelpful negative thought and acknowledging that you had it, without judging yourself for it.[16] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Trying to control or repress negative thoughts, such as saying Im not going to have negative thoughts! can actually make them worse. Its a bit like telling yourself not to think about purple elephants -- now, thats all you can imagine. Several studies have shown that acknowledging, rather than fighting, negative thoughts can help you work past them.[17] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source For example, if the thought shows up that you are unattractive, notice it by telling yourself something like, I am having the thought that Im unattractive. You arent accepting this as true or correct, just acknowledging that the thought exists."
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Cultivate mindfulness.,"Cultivate mindfulness. Mindfulness is a technique that invites you to learn to observe your emotions without heightened emotions.The principle of mindfulness is that you need to acknowledge and experience the negative thoughts and emotions before you can let them go. Mindfulness is not easy because it means becoming aware of the negative self-talk that often accompanies shame, like self-condemnations, comparisons with others, etc. However, the task is to acknowledge and recognize shame without getting caught up in or giving power to those emotions that arise. Research has shown that mindfulness-based therapy and techniques can facilitate self-acceptance and help reduce negative thoughts and feelings.[18] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Try to find a quiet space to practice mindfulness. Sit in a relaxed position and focus on your breathing. Count the inhales and exhales. Inevitably, your mind will wander. When this happens, don't chastise yourself but take note of what you are feeling. Don't judge it; just be aware of it. Try to bring attention back to your breath, as this is the real work of mindfulness. By acknowledging but de-centering your thoughts and not letting them take over, you are learning how to cope with negative feelings without actually trying to change them. In other words, you are changing your relationship to your thoughts and feelings. Some people have found that in doing this, eventually the content of your thoughts and emotions changes (for the better) too."
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Watch out for shoulds.,"Watch out for shoulds. Shoulds, musts, and oughts are often signs of an unhelpful rule or assumption that youve internalized. For example, you might think, I should not ask for help because that would show weakness, or you might think I ought to be more outgoing. When you notice this language, take the time to ask yourself some questions about these thoughts: How does this thought impact my life? For example, if you think I ought to be more outgoing or I wont have any friends, you might feel embarrassed when you dont accept social invitations. You might push yourself to go out with friends, even when you feel tired or could use the time to yourself. This could cause problems for you. Where did this thought come from? Thoughts often come from rules that we hold for ourselves. Perhaps your family were very extroverted and encouraged you to be highly social, even if youre an introvert. This might have led you to believe there was something wrong with being more quiet, which could lead to a negative core belief about yourself such as Im not good enough the way I am. Is this thought reasonable? In many cases, our negative core beliefs are based in overly inflexible and rigid thinking that holds us to unreasonable standards. For example, if youre an introvert, it may not be reasonable for you to be outgoing and social all the time. You may truly need time to yourself to recharge. You may not even be enjoyable company if you dont get that time you need. What do I gain from this thought? Consider whether you benefit from this thought or belief. Is it helpful to you?"
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Find flexible alternatives.,"Find flexible alternatives. Instead of the old rigid rules for yourself, look for more flexible alternatives. Often, substituting qualified terms such as sometimes, it would be nice if, Id like to, etc. is a good first step in making your expectations for yourself more reasonable. For example, instead of saying, I ought to be more outgoing or I wont have any friends, qualify your language with flexible terms: Sometimes I will accept invitations from friends, because friendship is important to me. Sometimes I will take time to myself, because I am also important. It would be nice if my friends understand my introversion, but even if they dont, I will take care of myself."
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Aim for a more balanced view of yourself.,"Aim for a more balanced view of yourself. Often, negative beliefs about yourself are extreme and totalizing. They say I am a failure or I am a loser. These beliefs allow for no grey area or balance. Try finding a more balanced view of these self-assessments. For example, if you frequently believe you are a failure because you make mistakes, try to make a more moderate statement about yourself: I am good at quite a few things, average at quite a few things, and not so good at a few things -- just like everyone else. You arent saying youre perfect, which would also be inaccurate. Youre acknowledging that, like every other human on the planet, you have strengths and areas for growth. If you frequently totalize yourself, such as Im a loser, or Im pathetic, rephrase this to acknowledge the grey area: I make mistakes sometimes. Note that this statement is not something you are, its something you do. You are not your mistakes or your unhelpful thoughts."
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Show yourself compassion.,"Show yourself compassion. If you feel yourself in danger of ruminating, that broken-record loop where you get stuck in an unhelpful thought pattern, nurture self-compassion and kindness. Instead of berating yourself and engaging in negative self-talk (i.e., ""I'm stupid and worthless""), treat yourself as you would a friend or other loved one. This requires careful observance of your behavior and the ability to step back and realize that you would not let a friend engage in this kind of self-destructive thinking.[19] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Research has suggested that self-compassion has numerous benefits, including mental well-being, increased life satisfaction, and decreased self-criticism, among others.[20] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source Offer yourself positive affirmations each and every day. This works to restore your sense of self-worth and increase the compassion you show for yourself. Set aside time each day to say aloud, write, or think affirmations. Some examples include: ""I am a good person. I deserve the best even if I have done some questionable things in my past""; ""I make mistakes and I learn from them""; ""I have lots to offer the world. I have value to myself and to others.""[21] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source You can practice compassion when you keep your journal. When youre tracking your negative thoughts, show yourself some kindness regarding them. For example, if you had the negative thought, I am so stupid and I will fail this test tomorrow, examine it with kindness. Remind yourself not to totalize yourself. Remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes. Plan on what you can do to avoid similar mistakes in the future. You could write something like, I am feeling stupid because I didnt study enough for this test. Everyone makes mistakes. I wish I had studied more, but I cant change that. Next time, I can study more than a day in advance, I can ask a tutor or my teacher for help, and I can use this experience to learn and grow from. Reader Poll: We asked 694 wikiHow readers about which positive affirmation works best for them, and only 8% said, My body is strong in every way. [Take Poll] While this mantra can still make you feel more positive, try reciting other phrases like I believe in myself or I am enough."
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Focus on the positive.,"Focus on the positive. Think about the good stuff. Chances are that you are not giving yourself enough credit for everything that you've done throughout your life. Impress yourself, not others. Take some time to reflect and look back at your past glories from big to small; this will not only help you become more aware of these accomplishments but can also help validate your place in the world and the value you bring to the people around you. Consider grabbing a notebook or journal and setting a timer for 10 to 20 minutes. During this time, write a list of all of your accomplishments and return to it as you have more to add![22] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source In this vein, you are becoming your own cheerleader. Give yourself positive encouragement and credit for the things you do. For example, you might note that although you're not getting all the exercise you'd like to be getting, you have been going to the gym one extra day a week."
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Use positive and hopeful statements and language.,"Use positive and hopeful statements and language. Be optimistic and avoid the self-fulfilling prophecy of pessimism. If you expect bad things, they often occur. For example, if you anticipate a presentation going poorly, it just might. Instead, be positive. Tell yourself, ""Even though it's going to be a challenge, I can handle this presentation.""[23] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source"
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Let go of the influences of others.,"Let go of the influences of others. If you have negative thoughts in your head, its possible you have people around you who are giving fodder to those same types of negative messages about you, even close friends and family. In order to let go of shame and move forward, you'll need to minimize ""toxic"" individuals who bring you down rather than lift you up. Consider the negative statements of others to be 10 pound weights. These weigh you down and it becomes more difficult to bring yourself back up. Free yourself from that burden and remember that people cannot define who you are as person. Only you can define who you are. You may also need to think about people who make you feel badly about yourself. You can't control anyone else's behavior; what you can control is how you respond and how you let their behavior impact you. If another person is unjustly rude, mean, or dismissive or disrespectful towards you, understand that he may have his own problems or emotional issues that is causing him to act negatively towards you. However, if this person is triggering your low self-esteem, it is best if you can walk away or remove yourself from situations where that person is present, particularly if he responds negatively if you try to confront him about his behavior."
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Surround yourself with positive social support.,"Surround yourself with positive social support. Almost all humans benefit from social and emotional support, whether it be from families, friends, co-workers and others in our social networks. It's helpful for us to talk to and strategize with others about our problems and issues. Oddly enough, social support actually makes us better able to cope on our own with our problems because it increases our self-esteem.[24] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Research has consistently shown a correlation between perceived social support and self-esteem, such that when people believe they have social support, their self-esteem and feelings of self-worth increase. Thus, if you feel supported by the people around you, you should feel better about yourself and better able to cope with negative feelings and stress. Know that when it comes to social support, there is no one-size-fits-all mentality. Some people prefer to have just a few close friends whom they can turn to, while others cast a wider net and find support among their neighbors or church or religious community.[25] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source Social support can also take new forms in our modern age. If you feel anxiety about having to talk to someone face-to-face, you can also stay connected with family and friends or meet new people via social media, video chats, and email.[26] X Trustworthy Source American Psychological Association Leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists Go to source"
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Extend a helping hand to others.,"Extend a helping hand to others. Research has shown that people who volunteer tend to have higher self-esteem than those who do not. It may seem counter-intuitive that aiding others helps you feel better about yourself, but the science does indeed suggest that feelings of social connectedness that accompany volunteering or helping others make us feel more positive about ourselves.[27] X Research source As a bonus, helping others makes us happier! In addition, you will also be making a real difference in someone's world. Not only will you be happier, but someone else might also be as well. There are so many opportunities out there to get involved with others and make a difference. Consider volunteering at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter. Offer to coach a children's sports team during the summer. Step in when a friend needs a hand and make them a bunch of meals to freeze. Volunteer at your local animal shelter."
How to Eradicate and Stop Negative Thoughts,Consult a mental health professional.,"Consult a mental health professional. If you are struggling to change or eradicate negative thinking and/or feel that your negative thoughts are adversely affecting your daily mental and physical functioning, you should make an appointment with a counselor, psychologist, or other mental health professional. Note that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is very helpful for changing thinking and is one of the most researched types of therapy and has strong evidence of its efficacy.[28] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source In many cases, a therapist can help you develop useful strategies to improve your self-image. Remember sometimes people just can't fix everything on their own. Moreover, therapy has been shown to have a significant effect on raising self-esteem and quality of life. In addition, a therapist can help you cope with any other mental health issues that you may be facing as a cause or consequence of your shame and low self-esteem, including depression and anxiety. Know that asking for help is a sign of strength, not a sign of personal failure or weakness.[29] X Research source"
How to Manage Pain After Knee Replacement Surgery: 11 Steps,Rest and elevate your leg.,"Rest and elevate your leg. Once you're discharged from the hospital, you'll be told to rest and elevate your leg for the first few days or so in order to help decrease swelling and inflammation, which also reduces pain.[3] X Research source While sitting on the sofa or a chair, prop your leg up with some pillows, but try not to hyperextend your knee and risk straining it  keep some flexion in the joint while resting. Consider putting a pillow under your knee at night while you sleep on your back to elevate the extremity. Total bed rest is not a good idea post-surgery because some movement (even in surrounding joints such as the hip and ankle) is needed to stimulate blood flow and healing. Wearing compression stockings can be another effective method for reducing achy pain and swelling, and preventing blood clot formation. Start wearing them day and night, then after a few weeks, switch to just while you sleep. There are two types of knee replacements: total knee replacements and partial knee replacements. Recovery from a total replacement takes longer  generally three to five days in the hospital and a recovery period lasting from one to three months.[4] X Research source"
How to Manage Pain After Knee Replacement Surgery: 11 Steps,Apply ice to your knee initially.,"Apply ice to your knee initially. While your knee is still in the acute phase (significant inflammation and pain), apply ice to it. The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all acute musculoskeletal injuries.[5] X Research source [6] X Expert Source Eric Christensen, DPTPhysical Therapist Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. Cold therapy should be applied to the area around the incision in order to reduce the swelling and pain, particularly in the muscles. Ice should be applied for 20 minutes every two to three hours for a couple of days, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside. Compressing the ice against your knee with a bandage or elastic support will also help control the inflammation, but don't tie it too tight because complete restriction of blood flow could cause more damage to your knee joint and lower leg.[7] X Expert Source Eric Christensen, DPTPhysical Therapist Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. Always wrap ice or frozen gel packs in a thin towel in order to prevent frostbite on your skin. If you don't have any ice or gel packs, then use a frozen bag of veggies from your freezer."
How to Manage Pain After Knee Replacement Surgery: 11 Steps,Use crutches to move around.,"Use crutches to move around. For the first few weeks post-surgery, try to use your crutches (which are typically supplied by the hospital) while walking around so as to not inflame your knee. Some knee mobility after a few days post-op is a good idea, but total weight bearing while walking should be postponed for a week or two until the muscles surrounding the knee have started to heal and gain their back strength.[8] X Expert Source Eric Christensen, DPTPhysical Therapist Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. You should be able to resume most normal activities of daily living (including walking and bending) within 3-6 weeks following knee replacement surgery. Some pain with walking and other knee movements, particularly at night, is common for several weeks after you've had knee surgery. If your right knee was replaced, then don't try to drive a car until you're fully recovered, which may take a few months. Your orthopedist will clear you when it is safe for you to drive."
How to Manage Pain After Knee Replacement Surgery: 11 Steps,Take your medications as advised.,"Take your medications as advised. You'll likely receive pain medication (either orally or intravenously) while in the hospital and then given strong prescription drugs to take home.[9] X Expert Source Eric Christensen, DPTPhysical Therapist Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. These medications may include strong opioids, such as morphine, fentanyl or oxycodone, which may have to be taken for a few weeks.[10] X Research source Medication is an important part of managing your pain, so follow your doctor's instructions carefully and be aware that abuse of pain medications can lead to dependency. Alternatively, you may be given prescription-strength nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or naproxen, or painkillers such as Tylenol #3. After a few weeks, you may be able to wean yourself to weaker over-the-counter offerings. Be careful not to take any medications on an empty stomach, as they can irritate the lining of your stomach and increase the risk of stomach ulcers. Pain-relieving creams containing capsaicin, menthol and/or salicylate may be of benefit also. Your doctor may also prescribe short-term antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection."
How to Manage Pain After Knee Replacement Surgery: 11 Steps,Consider moist heat after the acute stage.,"Consider moist heat after the acute stage. After the inflammation and pain in and around your knee has largely subsided, then consider applying some moist heat. The application of heat causes mild dilatation of blood vessels and helps to alleviate any stiffness. Microwaved herbal bags work well and are often infused with aromatherapy (such as lavender) that has relaxing properties. With the permission of your doctor, soak your leg in a warm Epsom salt bath, which can significantly reduce pain and swelling, especially within muscles. The magnesium in the salt helps the muscles relax. However, avoid soaking the wound in water until it has completely sealed and dried."
How to Manage Pain After Knee Replacement Surgery: 11 Steps,Seek out physiotherapy.,"Seek out physiotherapy. Physical therapy is an extremely important part of rehabbing after knee surgery and can begin as soon as 48 hours post-op.[11] X Research source after surgery. A physical therapist can show you specific and tailored stretches, mobilizations and strengthening exercises for your recuperating knee. Knee immobilizers are often used to stabilize the knee while undergoing physical therapy. Physiotherapy is usually required 2-3x per week for 6-8 weeks to positively impact a knee that's undergone surgery, although it may be longer.[12] X Expert Source Eric Christensen, DPTPhysical Therapist Expert Interview. 29 June 2021. [13] X Research source It will include a graduated walking program and knee-strengthening exercises. If need be, a physical therapist can stimulate, contract and strengthen your weakened leg muscles with electrotherapy, such as electronic muscle stimulation. For pain control, a physical therapist can use a TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) unit on your knee."
How to Manage Pain After Knee Replacement Surgery: 11 Steps,Use a continuous passive motion machine.,"Use a continuous passive motion machine. A device that can help speed knee recovery and reduce stiffness is the continuous passive motion (CPM) machine.[14] X Research source The CPM machine is attached to the recuperating leg and automatically moves the knee through various motions for up to an hour or so while the patient relaxes. This type of passive exercise can improve circulation and reduce the risk of scarring / contracture of the soft tissues surrounding the knee. CPM exercise machines also help to prevent blood clot formation in the legs. Some physical therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists (rehabilitation physicians) have CPM machines in their office, but not all of them."
How to Manage Pain After Knee Replacement Surgery: 11 Steps,Consider infrared therapy.,"Consider infrared therapy. The use of low-energy light waves (infrared) is known to be able to speed up the healing of wounds, decrease pain and decrease inflammation.[15] X Research source Use of infrared radiation (either through a hand-held device or within a special sauna) is believed to penetrate deep into the body and improve circulation because it creates heat and dilates blood vessels. In most cases, significant pain reduction can start within hours after the first infrared treatment. Pain reduction is often long lasting, weeks or even months. Practitioners most likely to use infrared therapy include some chiropractors, osteopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists."
How to Manage Pain After Knee Replacement Surgery: 11 Steps,Try acupuncture treatments.,"Try acupuncture treatments. Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within the skin / muscle in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation and to potentially stimulate healing.[16] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Acupuncture is not commonly recommended for pain control post surgery and should only be considered as a secondary option, but anecdotal reports suggest it can be helpful for many different types of musculoskeletal injuries. It's worth a try if your budget allows for it. Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture reduces pain and inflammation by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin. Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists  whoever you choose should be certified by NCCAOM."
How to Manage Pain After Knee Replacement Surgery: 11 Steps,Get a deep tissue massage.,"Get a deep tissue massage. Knee replacement surgery involves cutting into the muscles surrounding the knee joint in order to clean it up and resurface the ends of the bones. As such, the muscles experience severe trauma, which leads to inflammation and spasm post surgery. A deep tissue massage is helpful starting a few weeks after surgery because it reduces muscle spasm, combats inflammation and promotes relaxation. Start with a 30 minute leg massage, focusing on your thigh and hamstring muscles. Allow the therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate without wincing. Always drink lots of water immediately following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products and lactic acid from your body. Failure to do so might cause a headache or mild nausea."
How to Manage Pain After Knee Replacement Surgery: 11 Steps,Experiment with vibration therapy.,"Experiment with vibration therapy. An interesting alternative option in managing musculoskeletal pain is vibrational therapy. Vibrating frequencies seem to relax and strengthen musculature while stimulate nerves to reduce pain. In terms of knee pain, you can vibrate primarily the knee area or the entire body  both have proven effective for reducing knee pain.[17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Full-body vibrating machines are difficult to find in rehabilitation facilities and likely too expensive to buy for home use, so consider smaller machines that vibrate your feet and/or lower legs. A hand-held vibrating massage device is another option that may work well to stimulate and reduce pain in the muscles around your knee."
4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Define woman for yourself.,"Define woman for yourself. Despite the popular myths to the contrary, there arent that many innate differences between men and women. Male and female brains, for example, are virtually identical.[2] X Trustworthy Source Greater Good Magazine Journal published by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center, which uses scientific research to promote happier living Go to source While social and cultural pressures often have rigid standards for what counts as feminine, part of becoming a stronger woman is deciding just what woman means for your life. Reject standards and ideas that do not fit with who you want to be. Societies may have particularly rigid or oppressive standards for marginalized groups, such as women of color, religious minorities, or trans women. It can be difficult to balance developing your identity as the woman you want to be with maintaining personal safety. You have to decide for yourself what you feel comfortable with, and what is safe for you at a particular moment. Even some women can be unfortunately limiting when it comes to what they think counts as appropriate for women. Some people may try to say that you cannot be a feminist woman and a stay-at-home parent, while others may argue that having a career is incompatible with true womanhood. Remember that whatever you choose, whether its being a nurse or being a bodybuilder, is womanly, because youre a woman. Be aware that behavior that goes against accepted norms may meet with resistance. For example, women who wear clothing that is coded as sexy, such as short skirts and stiletto heels, may be perceived negatively, especially in the workplace. Women who wear clothes that are coded as modest, such as longer skirts and flats, are often perceived more positively at work. It can be difficult to navigate between what society accepts and what you want for yourself. Learning how to manage this balance is part of becoming a stronger woman."
4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Define your values.,"Define your values. Everyone has a set of core values. These values are your beliefs, ideas, and what you consider to be the most important things in life. Values guide the choices you make in life.

The questions and prompts below can be helpful in defining what you value.[6] X Research source https:/www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTED_85.htm Think about a few times when you were really happy. What were you doing? Who were you with? What was the situation like? Write these down. Think about a few times when you felt really proud of yourself. Why were you proud? Who shared that feeling with you? What contributed to this situation? Write these down. Think about some times when you felt fulfilled, satisfied, or content. What do you think led to that feeling? What need was being satisfied? What was meaningful about it? Write these down. If your house was on fire, what three things would you save? (Assume people and pets are safe.) Why? If you could change one thing about your community/neighborhood/workplace/world, what would it be? Why? What do you feel passionate about?"
4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Look for common patterns in the lists youve just made.,"Look for common patterns in the lists youve just made. Once youve compiled your responses to the prompts, think about what stands out in your answers. What appears to make you happy? What isnt as satisfying as you thought? For example, perhaps you chose to save your family photo albums in the hypothetical house fire, and discovered that you were with friends or family during most of the times you remember being really happy. That suggests that social values, such as Community, Friendship and Family-orientedness, may be very strong for you.[7] X Research source Similarly, perhaps you remember being proud of yourself when you had achieved a goal or made an accomplishment. Maybe a status or skill makes you satisfied. These things suggest that values such as Competitiveness, Achievement, and Excellence may be important to you. Remember that your values are yours, and they need not comply with anyone elses standards. They are not right or wrong. A list of possible values can be found at the Mind Tools page, What Are Your Values?[8] X Research source"
4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Ask yourself whether your choices are consistent with these values.,"Ask yourself whether your choices are consistent with these values. Just because we have core values doesnt mean we always act in accordance with them. There are many reasons why we might make choices that arent value-congruent. Because women are subjected to many social and cultural pressures, it can be difficult to choose options that do not conform to traditional expectations. There is a very strong sense of should for many women. Even worse, many of these shoulds are completely contradictory, such as the common social pressure to look sexually attractive but remain modest.[9] X Research source Accepting these shoulds can encourage you to make choices that arent in line with what you really value.[10] X Research source Think about a time when you made a difficult choice. For example, perhaps you decided to leave your baby with a daycare provider so that you could return to work. Was this because you felt pressured by others to return? This is an example of shoulding. Was it because you find personal fulfillment at work that you missed? This could be an example of a value-congruent choice. Sometimes, necessity can mean you have to make choices that arent ideal. Try to make as many choices in your life that are value-congruent as possible. That will make the compromises you must make easier to deal with."

In the United States, more than 7 out of 10 mothers with children work, and more than one half of all married couples have both partners working. These numbers mean that at some point, you will probably have to determine how you want to balance your family life with your career.[11] X Research source Unfortunately, American society still has a strong stigma against mothers who work outside the home, with only 21% of Americans seeing it as positive. Recognize that the woman who has it all is a myth. Determining your core values will help you decide what to prioritize, because you will sometimes have to prioritize one thing over another.

4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Consider your many roles.,"Consider your many roles. Many women play multiple roles in their lives: daughter, sister, partner, mother, etc. These roles are often socially prescriptive, and society can encourage women to define their identities solely in terms of their relationships to others: Im my husbands wife, my childs mother, my mothers daughter, my brothers sister, etc.[13] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source Because many cultures teach women to understand themselves relationally, through their connections with others, many women struggle with finding an identity separate from their families. In addition to your relationships with others, consider what other roles you play. Are you a musician, a chef, a lover of comic books? Perhaps you are a skydiver or surfer or chess-player. Thinking about what roles you play in addition to those that connect you to others can give you a deeper sense of yourself. Women who do not follow the traditional route of marriage and motherhood are also often stigmatized. Women without children may experience pressure to have them, or intense questioning about why they do not.[14] X Research source Determining what you value will help you deal with these social and cultural pressures."

4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Learn to say no.,"Learn to say no. Women are often taught to be people pleasers. Society has very strong traditional gender roles that teach women to appease, keep the peace, and serve others.[17] X Research source Women are often socialized to be nice and consider others feelings, often at the detriment of their own.[18] X Research source Learning to say no can be hard, but its a crucial part of becoming a stronger woman.[19] X Research source Be aware that setting boundaries and enforcing them, especially at work, can be met with backlash. Because women are typically considered to be helpers, behavior that appears to go against this perception may be interpreted negatively. One way to say no productively in work situations can be to remind the person making the request what else youre working on. For example, you could ask to sit down with your boss: That does sound important. I have a lot on my plate right now, so lets sit down together for a few minutes so you can help me find a way to prioritize my projects. I want to make sure I focus on the most important things.[20] X Research source Take 24 hours to decide before agreeing to something. You can always say, Let me think about that and get back with you. This will give you the time to consider whether this request is a good opportunity, and whether you can really afford the time it will take.[21] X Research source Its also okay to say no to friends. You can say something like, I really wish I could help you move this weekend, but Ive already committed to such-and-such or I would usually love to go to your party, but Ive had a rough week and need some time to unwind on my own this weekend.

Write down any times when you feel upset, when you judge yourself, or when you experienced pain. Then, use mindfulness, common humanity, and self-kindness to process these feelings. For example, imagine that someone said something hurtful about your appearance. Write how you felt, how you reacted, and what you did. Try not to judge yourself or your experience: A person on the bus made a comment about my body. I felt hurt and embarrassed. Next, acknowledge that this experience is part of being human: Its natural to feel hurt when someone is unkind. Finally, give yourself some words of comfort: That person did not know me, and they judged me for something I cannot control. Thats their loss. I am beautiful, and I can be kind to others.

4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Counter negative self-talk.,"Counter negative self-talk. Negative self-talk can be very damaging. Unfortunately, many of us seem to play negative thoughts on a loop at the back of our minds without even thinking. Take the time to challenge negative thoughts about yourself with positive statements. You may find that speaking these statements out loud helps, too.[27] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, imagine that you are at the grocery store and your child is misbehaving. You snap at her, and immediately regret your behavior. A negative thought could appear such as, Im a terrible mother. This is an unfair generalization about you from one specific event. Instead, remind yourself that you are human as you acknowledge your mistake. I snapped at my daughter, which was wrong. I can do better next time. Challenging negative thoughts does not mean you dont take responsibility for when you do something wrong. For example, you would still apologize to your daughter for snapping at her even if you rejected your negative self-talk about the incident. The difference is that in one case you generalize yourself as a failure, and in the other, you recognize and acknowledge a mistake. This latter way of thinking promotes growth and real strength."
4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Challenge personalization.,"Challenge personalization. Personalization is a common distortion of perception in which we automatically blame ourselves for anything that goes wrong. Because social and cultural pressures often encourage women to view themselves as responsible for everyone elses well-being, personalization could be a difficult challenge for you to overcome. Realizing that you are not responsible for others can help you feel stronger. For example, if your romantic partner has been less interested in sex recently, a personalizing approach would be to blame yourself: My partner doesnt want to have sex with me because of something I did. A way to challenge this distortion is to recognize that the other person has his/her own life and thoughts that youre not always aware of. Your partner could be under a lot of stress at work, fighting off a cold, not feeling attractive themselves, or a host of other things that are not your fault. Communicating directly can be a good way to challenge personalization. For example, you could talk with your partner about why s/he has had a lower sex drive recently. Approach the issue without judgment, just ask the other person whats going on and invite him/her to share with you: I noticed that we havent had sex in a while. I miss that experience with you. Would you like to talk about whats going on?"
4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Practice self-kindness.,"Practice self-kindness. Women are often under a lot of pressure to do everything and be everything. Were taught to strive for perfection because perfection is often mistakenly equated with excellence. We are also taught that not achieving perfection means failure. However, many research studies demonstrate that perfectionism actually holds you back, and that the most successful people are often those who embrace mistakes as learning experiences for the future.[28] X Research source Remind yourself that excellence is not a result of perfection. Excellence is the product of setting meaningful goals and working hard to attain them. A productive way to be excellent is to treat yourself as a mentor would treat you: with respect, trust, understanding, compassion, empathy, and kindness. Try approaching yourself as you would a loved friend or family member. You likely do not judge your friends harshly for their flaws. Show yourself that same compassion. Many studies have shown that perfectionism can actually hurt your performance and achievement.[29] X Trustworthy Source Association for Psychological Science Nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences Go to source Perfectionism can also lead to procrastination, where you never start working on your goals because you believe you wont be able to achieve them the way you want.[30] X Research source"

For example, one study showed that people who were asked to wear lab coats while performing a simple scientific task were more attentive and more confident than those who didnt wear lab coats.[40] X Research source Find clothes that make you feel good about yourself and express something about you. Ignore the labels. For many women, the size on the clothing label is inversely related to our self-esteem: the higher the number, the worse we may feel about ourselves. Not only is the number on the tag just a number, its also completely arbitrary.[41] X Research source One stores 4 is another stores 12.[42] X Research source Dont let these random numbers determine your worth! Understand that many workplaces require more conservative dressing for women. It isnt fair, but its unfortunately true that women who wear clothes that seem too alluring, such as lower-cut blouses or short skirts or flashy jewelry, may not be taken seriously in the workplace. See if you can navigate a balance between what will get you respect and what will express yourself."
4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Masturbate more often.,"Masturbate more often. Womens sexuality is commonly a taboo topic, and womens self-pleasuring even more so. Masturbation is often surrounded by myths, misinformation, and guilt.[43] X Research source However, research has shown that regular masturbation has a variety of health benefits for women. Getting in touch with your body can help you feel stronger, healthier, and happier.[44] X Research source [45] X Research source There is no one right or wrong way to masturbate. Explore your body and learn what makes you feel good. If you use sex toys or implements, make sure to read the directions and keep them clean and safe.[46] X Research source It may seem awkward at first, but having a look at your genitals can help you figure out what your body looks like and where you can focus your attentions.[47] X Research source [48] X Research source Masturbating releases endorphins, which are natural mood-elevators and help relieve feelings of stress and anxiety. This happens even if you dont reach orgasm.[49] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Masturbation can help ease difficulties associated with menopause and post menopause, such as vaginal narrowing or dryness.[50] X Research source Masturbation can help you sleep better. As you near sexual climax, your body releases dopamine, a feel-good hormone. After orgasm, your body releases endorphins and oxytocin, which may help you relax into a good nights sleep.[51] X Research source An added benefit of masturbation is that it will help you learn what gives you pleasure and what doesnt. You can share that information with your partner(s) to help them understand what turns you on. Women who masturbate are more likely to experience a happy sex life with a partner. They also report enjoying sex more than women who dont masturbate.[52] X Research source [53] X Research source [54] X Research source Helpful books on female masturbation and orgasm include Dr. Vivienne Casss The Elusive Orgasm: A Womans Guide to Why She Cant and How She Can Orgasm and Dr. Sadie Allisons Tickle Your Fancy: A Womans Guide to Sexual Self-Pleasure."

4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Reject stereotypes about womens sexuality.,"Reject stereotypes about womens sexuality. Each womans body is unique, and what arouses you is also unique. Unfortunately, there is a world of misinformation out there. Theres also a tendency to speak about womens sexuality as something shameful or dirty. It isnt. These myths and misinformation are harmful to your health and happiness. Embracing your sexual health will help you feel stronger and more fulfilled.[57] X Research source [58] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source For example, an extremely common myth is that men think about sex more often than women do. Youve probably heard the Men think about sex every 2 seconds myth before. However, studies have shown that most adult men and women think about sex with about the same frequency.[59] X Research source Another common myth is that women dont enjoy casual sex. This is also untrue. Studies have shown that under certain circumstances, women are just as likely to be interested in casual sex as men are. However, there are two mitigating factors: safety and social perception. Women are more likely to be concerned about their physical safety when accepting a casual sexual encounter. (With good reason: statistics show that 1 in 5 women report experiencing rape during their lives.) Because society has a strong tendency to characterize women who have casual sex as immoral or otherwise negative, women are also more likely to consider whether their behavior will be stigmatized before accepting casual sex. A third common myth is that women dont want or need to masturbate. However, more than half of women aged 18-49 report masturbating at least once in the previous 90 days. Women between the ages of 18-24 are actually slightly more likely to masturbate than men the same age.[60] X Research source"
4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Share your needs with your partner.,"Share your needs with your partner. Women are often not taught to speak up for ourselves. However, sharing your desires and needs with your partner can be an excellent bonding experience.[61] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Agree on a good time to talk. Just before bedtime, during chores time, or while Game of Thrones is on isnt a good time to have an open discussion about your sex life. Choose a time when both of you can focus on each other without distraction. Use open, honest terms. Dont feel embarrassed to use appropriate language to express what you like. Your partner may not understand euphemisms. Be as specific as possible.[62] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try to avoid sounding blaming or judging when you express your needs. If your partner feels blamed, s/he will likely tune out of the discussion, or feel guilty or hurt. For example, its unproductive to say something like: Youre not giving me what I need. Instead, you can talk about your own feelings and experience: Ive felt rushed lately during sex. I would enjoy it more if we slowed down and took our time. Invite your partner to share his/her feelings and experience. Remember, sex is a mutual experience. Make sure youre also acknowledging your partners needs and experiences."
4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Own your sexuality.,"Own your sexuality. Just like with other areas of confidence in your life, sexual confidence comes from knowing and accepting your desires and needs. This knowledge and acceptance will help you be open to sharing your desires and needs with partners, if you want them. But remember: your sexuality is yours to do with as you decide. No one has the right to pressure or guilt you into (or out of) sex.[63] X Research source The sexual response cycle for females is generally more complex than for males. Rather than a linear model of desire, arousal, and orgasm, women may cycle through these phases in different orders, or may not experience one or more of the phases.[64] X Research source [65] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Women may be more interested in sex as a way to express their emotions than men.[66] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Women may also feel satisfied with sex even if it does not result in orgasm.[67] X Research source Learn what works for you, and realize that there is no normal except what your own body does for you.

4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Communicate assertively.,"Communicate assertively. Women are often taught to be nurturers, and women who communicate assertively may be seen as shrill, angry or pushy.[68] X Research source [69] X Research source [70] X Research source However, learning to communicate your needs and ideas in an assertive way will help you feel stronger and more confident. Here are some ways to communicate assertively:[71] X Research source [72] X Research source Varenhorst, B. (2003). An Asset Builder's Guide to Training Peer Helpers : Fifteen Sessions on Communication, Assertiveness, and Decision-making Skills. Minneapolis, MN: Independent Publishers Group. Use I-focused statements to convey your reactions and feelings. For example, I dont like it when you forget to take the trash out. It makes me feel as though you are not sharing the household responsibilities with me. Give constructive criticism without judging. For example, I feel frustrated when you rush me to get ready. It makes me feel anxious and its harder for me to enjoy our time out. I would like you to stay out of our room while I get ready. Use co-operative phrases, such as What are your thoughts on this? or What would you do? Make clear statements of wants and needs. For example, I want to take a dance class is clear, whereas I kind of think it would be nice if we took a dance class is unclear. Speak in a clear, calm voice. Dont shout or murmur. Keep your tone relaxed and steady. Dont use avoidance or distraction techniques such as sarcasm, fake humor, or self-deprecation. These will make it harder for others to know when you are being serious and when youre joking."
4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Use assertive body language.,"Use assertive body language. It can sometimes be hard to feel as though others take you seriously. While you cannot change others beliefs, and some people will remain stubbornly prejudiced against women, you can alter how you present yourself to communicate strength and confidence.[73] X Research source Claim your space. You dont have to take more than you need, but women may subconsciously make themselves smaller by tucking their feet under their chairs, folding their hands in their laps, or crossing their legs or ankles. Studies have shown that these timid body postures can actually make you feel more anxious and unconfident.[74] X Research source Claim your space by planting your feet firmly on the floor while sitting. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Lean back in your chair or use your armrests.[75] X Research source Stand with your shoulders back and your chest out. Slouching can communicate weakness or timidity. Keep your arms uncrossed. Crossed arms indicate that youre closed off to communicating, or that youre trying to defend yourself. Make eye contact. Aim for maintaining eye contact at least 50% of the time while speaking, and at least 70% of the time while listening.[76] X Trustworthy Source Michigan State University Extension Extension program of Michigan State University focused on community outreach, education, and engagement Go to source Use relaxed, smooth gestures. Avoid pointing; use an open palm to gesture instead. Dont shift your weight back and forth. Distribute your weight evenly."
4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Speak up for others.,"Speak up for others. Research has shown that women who behave assertively may face backlash due to social prejudices. However, this research also suggests that women who behave assertively in support of others are more likely to be viewed positively.[77] X Research source Frame your assertiveness as benefitting the team, rather than only yourself, and you may find that more people listen to you. This may be because advocacy for others conforms to the stereotypical gender norm that women are nurturers or helpers. Its important to recognize that this norm isnt universally true, but it is commonly accepted. Sometimes, you have to work within a limiting framework while you work to change it. For example, you could frame your request for a larger office this way: Were working on that big project, and I could really use a bigger office to accommodate the extra files and team members. If I had the corner office to work in, wed have an easier time making headway on this project."
4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Support other women in your workplace.,"Support other women in your workplace. Research has demonstrated that society tends to confound gender and status so thoroughly that, if status isnt externally conferred or confirmed by others, people will assume women to automatically have lower status than men who are in the same position. However, supporting and speaking up for other women in your workplace can help confirm their status and improve how others treat them.[78] X Research source For example, imagine that you have a position in upper management, and you have two assistant managers beneath you: one male and one female. If someone interacting with your assistant managers makes the mistake of assuming that the male AM is higher up than the female AM, gently correct the mistake: Actually, Juanita is the same rank as Joseph. She can easily help you with what you need."
4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Consider the context when making requests.,"Consider the context when making requests. Research has shown that women are more able to act assertively, make requests, and seek resources when those resources are plentiful. In times when business is good, the restrictions on normative gender behavior may loosen a little.[79] X Research source For example, asking for a raise right after your company has posted a quarterly loss isnt likely to be effective for anyone, but particularly for women. However, if your company just closed a big deal or landed a big client, it could be just the right time for you to make your request. Several studies have shown that women who can be more flexible or more assertive, depending on the situation, get more promotions than either men or other women.[80] X Research source"
4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Accept praise.,"Accept praise. Women may be taught to diminish the value of their efforts. Women are often told that they should be humble and reject compliments and statements of praise.[81] X Research source Learning to accept praise when its given can help you realize the value of your efforts. For example, if your boss tells you you did a great job on your presentation, dont feel compelled to say something like, Oh, it was nothing, really. Instead, take credit for your real accomplishment, and acknowledge others if appropriate: Thank you! I put some long hours in to prepare for it and Im glad it went well. I had some great help from Shao, too. This is very different from accepting sexual harassment masked as a compliment. You are under no obligation to acknowledge or appreciate cat-calling, unsolicited comments on your appearance, or any other statements that may be presented as compliments."
4 Ways to Become a Stronger Woman - wikiHow,Involve your partner.,"Involve your partner. Many couples have dual breadwinners, but the strong gendered norms in most societies mean that women are still considered to hold primary responsibility for household duties, such as getting kids to school, caring for the house, cooking meals, etc. Studies suggest that women in heterosexual couples carry out 67 percent of household duties and cook up to 91 percent of weekday dinners.[82] X Research source If youre in this situation, attain a better balance by asking your partner for his/her help.[83] X Research source Research has shown that couples who create a system to share responsibility for household duties are significantly happier overall than couples who dont.[84] X Research source Approach duty-sharing as collaboration, rather than blaming or guilting. For example, sit down with your partner and discuss what duties each of you is best equipped to handle. Decide together on a schedule or rotation. This will help keep one of you from feeling like the others constant reminder or caretaker.[85] X Research source Standing up for your needs is important; you will not be able to care for others if you dont first care for yourself."
How to Enjoy Yourself (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Eat well.,"Eat well.

How to Enjoy Yourself (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Exercise regularly.,"Exercise regularly. Exercise has been shown to boost self-esteem, reduce stress and anxiety, and to improve sleep.[1] X Research source Exercise for at least 20 to 30 minutes, three times a week.

Studies have linked a lack of sleep to depression.[2] X Research source You can help ward off depression by getting enough sleep: adults need 7 to 9 hours each night; teenagers need about 8.5 to 9.5 hours.[3] X Research source If you have trouble falling asleep, try creating a routine in which you go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.

How to Enjoy Yourself (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Give up on happiness.,"Give up on happiness. Sometimes the more you want something, the more difficult it is to get. The more you obsess over wanting to be happy, the more likely you are to focus on how unhappy you are. By placing pressure on yourself to be happy, you're more likely to achieve the opposite. Instead of pressuring yourself to be happy, acknowledge that it's your goal, and then do the things that will help you achieve it  for example, being mindful, being kind to yourself, and exercising regularly. It may help you to make an action plan of how you want to be happier in life. Once you've written down your plan, it may be easier to focus on the steps you need to take to be happy, rather than on achieving the abstract feeling of happiness itself."
How to Enjoy Yourself (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Take responsibility for yourself.,"Take responsibility for yourself. Instead of complaining about something, consider what you can do to fix the situation. You are the only person who can make yourself happy.

You can't fix what you refuse to even think about.[5] X Expert Source Amy WongLeadership & Transformational Coach Expert Interview. 30 April 2020. Even if someone has done something hurtful to you, it does not benefit you to dwell too much on the pain. You can't control their actions, and you can't force them to make things better for you; you can only control your own actions and emotions. This may sound harsh, but it's actually very positive.

How to Enjoy Yourself (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Be positive.,"Be positive. Don't dwell on the bad things in your life. Try to see the good in everything  even things you dislike. For example, you have to go to a class that you hate, but at least you'll see your best friend there. Part of being positive is believing in yourself. Combat negative self-talk with positive affirmations. Example: instead of saying, I am so stupid for failing that test, say I'll need to study harder next time or I am disappointed that I didn't pass that test; what can I do to ensure that I pass next time?

Countless studies and spiritual gurus claim that the better we are at living in the moment, the happier we are.[7] X Research source To live in the moment, the first step is to develop a nonjudgmental awareness of yourself and the world around you: try observing your thoughts without judgment. Do not dwell on those thoughts or rush to push them away; simply let them be.[8] X Research source When you walk to the store to get groceries, don't focus on what you need to buy once you get there. Focus on how the ground feels beneath your feet; how the air feels against your skin; how it feels to breathe and walk; focus on the moment that you occupy right now.

It involves anything from blocking out your time each day to cleaning up your home and getting rid of things you no longer need.[15] X Research source One great way to gain some control over your day-to-day life is to block out your time in an hourly diary: Choose a diary that shows your entire week over a two-page spread.

How to Enjoy Yourself (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Be forgiving.,"Be forgiving. If you hold on to anger about things that have happened in your past, you'll have trouble being happy. Forgive others and forgive yourself. This doesn't mean forgetting; it's more about letting go of anger. One doctor suggests the following exercise:[17] X Research source Identify someone you're angry with. Don't start with someone with whom you have deep-seated issues; start with someone who will likely be easier to forgive, like that person who cut you off in traffic the other day, or someone who pushed past you in the hallway at school, if you're still holding on to that. Get the anger out. Write your feelings down in a journal; discuss your feelings with friends, a therapist, or other supportive people. Work out whether you want to raise the issue with anyone. Picture the person in your mind, and ask yourself what they might have been dealing with on a person level, for them to have treated you that way. Putting yourself in their shoes will help you view them with more compassion, and may help you to forgive them. Note that this doesn't make their actions okay.

How to Make Divining or Dowsing Rods Using Wood or Metal,Find or cut a forked (Y-shaped) branch.,"Find or cut a forked (Y-shaped) branch. This branch can stem from a tree, a bush  any substantial wood source. Find or use pruners to cut a branch that is at least a foot long, from tip to tip. Make sure that the forks are relatively equal in length; otherwise, your dowsing rod may be unbalanced.[1] X Research source Scan the ground for forked twigs that have already broken  perhaps by the passing of a deer, or perhaps by something more mysterious. If you see a perfect Y-shape that is still growing from a tree, feel free to cut it off and use it; some dowsers prefer rods that are freshly cut. If you break the forked branch from a tree, do it with intention. Think about the tree, the surrounding area, and why you are commissioning this dowsing rod. Consider leaving something of your own behind to replace what you have taken from the tree."
How to Make Divining or Dowsing Rods Using Wood or Metal,Try to find the branch in the same area that you'll be using it.,"Try to find the branch in the same area that you'll be using it. If you're going to be using this dowsing rod to, say, explore an unfamiliar stretch of woods, or look for water in a mysterious valley, try to find your dowsing rod nearby. Look at the brush at the edge of the woods; look for a tree at the rim of the valley. Some dowsers prefer to use branches from particular trees.[2] X Research source Hazel and witch hazel branches are commonly used in Europe and the U.S., respectively  as are willow and peach tree cuttings.[3] X Research source These branches are popular because they are light and porous: many believe that rods from these trees can better absorb vapors rising from buried metals or water, which weighs down the un-forked end so that it points toward the source."
How to Make Divining or Dowsing Rods Using Wood or Metal,"Decorate the dowsing rod, if desired.","Decorate the dowsing rod, if desired. If you only plan to use your rod once, you may not care to decorate it, but if you intend to use it frequently, or if you plan to give it to someone as a gift, decorating your rod can make it more unique. Consider carving patterns into the dowsing rod (carefully!) with a knife, wrapping beads or charms around the wood, or even painting portions of it. Wrapping pretty fabric such as lace or printed cotton or silk onto your rod will give it some flair, and it'll also make your rod easier to hold. You can approach decoration minimalistically and just paint your rod, or you can go all out by adding dangling beads, feathers, charms, or ribbons, or covering your rod in glitter. If you don't want to carve your rod, check out the stamp selection at your local craft store. There may be nature-themed designs you can print onto your rod for decoration."
How to Make Divining or Dowsing Rods Using Wood or Metal,Use your rod,"Use your rod by holding one fork in each hand and pointing it away from you. Grip the handles of your dowsing rod in an underhanded grasp, with the heels of your hands facing upward and the rod (the bottom section of the Y) away from you at arm's length. Make sure that the fork is parallel with the ground or tilted very slightly downward. Walk slowly around until your divining rod discovers something![4] X Research source Youll know youve found what youre looking for when the butt end of the rod points sharply downward at the ground, or when it whirls around and around. Some people believe the number of times your divining rod bobs indicates the depth (in feet or fathoms or other common units of measurements) of the item you're searching for. Historically, divining rods were used exclusively to locate water underground, but some people use them to locate all sorts of things, from money to dead bodies. There's not enough scientific evidence to suggest divining rods work for certain, but there are many people who claim to have had success using them.[5] X Research source"
How to Make Divining or Dowsing Rods Using Wood or Metal,"Acquire 2 equal lengths of wire, each about 20 inches (50.8 cm) long.","Acquire 2 equal lengths of wire, each about 20 inches (50.8 cm) long. The wire can be brass, copper, steel  any sturdy but bendable material. For an easy divining rod, try cutting a wire coat hanger into 2 equal pieces  or straightening 2 coat hangers by untwisting their hooks. You could also use metal antennae from an old radio or TV.[6] X Research source Choose the rod material based on purpose and availability. Brass and copper are especially popular because they don't rust. If you have wire fencing or coat hangers readily available, however, it won't hurt to work with what you have. Use a strong pair of wire cutters to trim the metal to size. There is no hard, fast rule that the wires must be 20 inches (50.8 cm) long. Make sure that they are long enough to dip of their own accord, and short enough to hold comfortably."
How to Make Divining or Dowsing Rods Using Wood or Metal,"Bend each wire into an ""L"" shape.","Bend each wire into an ""L"" shape. If your wires are 20 inches (50.8 cm) long, make the twist about 5 inches (12.7 cm) from one end. Be sure the bend creates a 90-degree angle in the wire. The short leg will become the handle of each rod. The longer legs will dip, cross, and guide you as you approach what you are looking for.[7] X Research source"
How to Make Divining or Dowsing Rods Using Wood or Metal,Use cloth or other material to cover the dowsing rod's handles.,"Use cloth or other material to cover the dowsing rod's handles. Create handles to cover the smaller legs of the L-shaped rods  4-5 inches of the wire, or whatever is comfortable. The handles will protect your hands and give you a firmer grip. There is no one way to make a usable handle, so work with what you have available, whether its cloth or a hollow dowel rod. Use a length of 1 inch (2.5 cm) dowel rod, with a hole through the center. Alternatively, glue several cotton reels together into a cylinder. Use a pen. Remove the innards and caps of 2 cheap plastic pens, then thread the wire through the pen body. You may also pass the wire through a couple of drinking straws. Wrap a rag, a cloth, or a piece of felt around the shorter leg of each ""L."" Tie the cloth in place with tightly-stretched rubber bands, a piece of twine, or even a safety pin."
How to Make Divining or Dowsing Rods Using Wood or Metal,Hold one rod in each hand when dowsing.,"Hold one rod in each hand when dowsing. Hold the wire by the handle (the shorter leg of the ""L"") so that the long part is parallel with the ground, with the rod resting flat over your index finger and the butt of the handle fitting into the heel of your hand. Make sure to hold the dowsing rods loosely enough that they can swing freely from side to side, but tightly enough that they won't fall from your grip. Hold the rods at arms length away from the body and about 9 inches apart. Remember to keep the rods parallel with the ground or tipped very slightly downward. Many people use dowsing rods to find water and other tangible objects, but some folks believe copper dowsing rods can be used to locate and manipulate energies that follow an invisible grid along the earth's surface. If the rods whirl counterclockwise, it's a sign of negative energy; if they spin clockwise, it indicates positive energy. These dowsers will use their copper rods to locate positive energy fields on which to build hospitals or sacred spaces, and they will place copper rods in areas with negative energy in order to cure that area of its bad chi.[8] X Research source Some dowsers also use metal dowsing rods to answer questions about the future or about decisions they must make, with the rods turning to the left to indicate a ""no"" or right to indicate a ""yes.""[9] X Research source"

3 Ways to Teach Yourself to Play Bass Guitar - wikiHow,Focus on chord tones and patterns to start.,"Focus on chord tones and patterns to start. The chord tones are the first note (the ""root"")' the third and the fifth. In the key of C Major, the root, third and fifth are the notes C, E and G. In some types of music, you may play the flatted seventh. In the key of C Major, the flatted seventh is B flat. Most bass lines are composed of outlines of chord tones. Pick a chord to practice each week, and play the chord tones. Once you're comfortable with the chord tones, figure out how the chord fits into a scale and you can practice creating a short bass line.[2] X Research source Drilling arpeggios (the first, third and fifth note of a chord, often also going up to the octave of the root) is a good way to start practicing bass and learn the fundamentals that go into strong, supportive bass lines. Start slow, and gradually up the tempo."
3 Ways to Teach Yourself to Play Bass Guitar - wikiHow,Mute strings to keep the sound clean.,"Mute strings to keep the sound clean. A bass line is made up of individual notes played cleanly. If a string keeps vibrating, the sound bleeds over into the next note. Mute strings below the note you're playing with your plucking hand. Use your fretting hand to mute the strings above the note you're playing.[3] X Research source With every note, you want only one string to ring out while you mute the other three. It takes a lot of practice to coordinate your hands properly to mute all the strings you're not playing. Go slowly and have patience. Expect to get frustrated at first. Just keep at it, and it will eventually click."

When you're just getting started, a metronome can help you.[4] X Research source Eventually you'll need to keep tempo without relying on a metronome  especially if you plan to perform live. Train your ear to recognize different tempos. When you're playing with a drummer, synchronize your playing with theirs."
3 Ways to Teach Yourself to Play Bass Guitar - wikiHow,"To add interest to your basslines, try hammer-ons and pull-offs to play more notes in sequence.","To add interest to your basslines, try hammer-ons and pull-offs to play more notes in sequence. Pluck a string, and while the note is still ringing, press your finger further down the string to play a higher note without plucking. Pull-offs work the opposite way. Pluck the string to play a higher note, then pull off a finger to play a lower note.[5] X Research source Pull-offs are generally a little more difficult than hammer-ons. When you're just starting, you may want to pluck the string lightly as you pull off your finger to make sure the second note rings out. With practice, you can use hammer-ons and pull-offs together to create quicker and more complicated bass lines."
3 Ways to Teach Yourself to Play Bass Guitar - wikiHow,"Play with tabulature notation (""tabs"") if you want to learn songs quickly.","Play with tabulature notation (""tabs"") if you want to learn songs quickly. A bass tab shows the four strings of the bass drawn horizontally. The lowest (thickest) string is always at the bottom of the tab, the highest (thinnest) string is at the top. Notes are indicated by the number of the fret on the string where the note should be played.[6] X Research source If you don't know how to read standard music notation, tabs enable you to start playing songs almost immediately. This can increase your confidence as you develop your ability as a bass player. You can find tabs for most popular songs online. Look for beginner tabs, which are more simplified versions."
3 Ways to Teach Yourself to Play Bass Guitar - wikiHow,Learn music notation and theory to advance your ability.,"Learn music notation and theory to advance your ability. Even if you've learned how to read music in connection with playing the guitar, reading bass music is a little different. The notes for a bass guitar are on the bass clef, with the lines and spaces representing different notes.[7] X Research source You can remember the names of the notes on the bass clef's lines and spaces with a mnemonic (memory aid). The most common mnemonics are ""Good Boys Do Fine Always"" for the lines (from the lowest line to the highest), and ""All Cows Eat Grass"" for the spaces (from the lowest space to the highest). Feel free to create your own mnemonic if you can come up with something that's easier for you to remember. If you only want to learn to play a little bass to entertain your family and friends or jam with pals, learning music notation may not be the best use of your time. However, if you want to play bass for a living, it's a sound investment."
3 Ways to Teach Yourself to Play Bass Guitar - wikiHow,Try to warm up for at least 20 minutes before playing.,"Try to warm up for at least 20 minutes before playing. After gently stretching your wrists and forearms, play some arpeggios or go through a familiar bass line. Play slowly, allowing your fingers to get accustomed to the movement.[8] X Research source If you plan to play for several hours, you may want to have a longer warm up. If your forearms and wrists feel sore after playing, try a longer warm-up period next time you play. You can also use the warm-up time to tune your bass or check for any problems."
3 Ways to Teach Yourself to Play Bass Guitar - wikiHow,Set aside time each day for your instrument.,"Set aside time each day for your instrument. You can't teach yourself to play bass without putting time into it. If you don't work on something bass-related every day, you run the risk of forgetting what you've learned, causing your progress to stagnate.[9] X Research source Your time doesn't have to be devoted exclusively to playing your bass. You can also spend time reading books about music, as well as watching concert videos or listening to songs that include some of your favorite bassists. When you watch other bassists for the purpose of practice, note their posture and hand positions. Get your bass guitar out and try to mimic them as they play."
3 Ways to Teach Yourself to Play Bass Guitar - wikiHow,Set up your amplifier.,"Set up your amplifier. Setting up the amplifier for your bass is similar to setting up an electric guitar amplifier. Plug the amp into the wall, then turn down the volume and gain before you plug your bass in.[10] X Research source For most bass amps, turn up the gain to between 10 o'clock and 1 o'clock. Experiment until you get a sound you like. Gain is similar to volume, but controls the volume of your bass coming into the pre-amp. Adjusting the gain changes the tone of your instrument. Generally, set the EQ between 500-800Hz for the best tone control."
3 Ways to Teach Yourself to Play Bass Guitar - wikiHow,Practice tuning your bass.,"Practice tuning your bass. The process of tuning your bass is similar to tuning a guitar or any other stringed instrument. On a 4-string bass, the strings themselves are tuned to E, A, D, and G. The E string is the lowest pitch, the G string is the highest. A bass is tuned one octave lower than a guitar.[11] X Research source Tuning by ear, using a guide note, will help you become more familiar with the tones.

Unless you are trained in fighting or martial arts, putting yourself in harm's way is not wise unless you have no other option. If possible, hide, escape, or fend off your attacker by other means. If the intruder has a gun or other deadly weapon, an unsuccessful physical attack is likely to put yourself at greater risk. Be smart and only use these techniques as a last resort."
How to Defend Yourself if Someone Breaks into Your Home While You Are Alone,Punch the bottom of your opponent's chin.,"Punch the bottom of your opponent's chin. You should do this from the neutral stance, swivelling your hips for momentum as you land the punch with force. This move can kill people if done too powerfully, as the head will snap back and the neck could break. If you wouldn't kill in defence, it is best to avoid this move.[5] X Research source [6] X Research source"
How to Defend Yourself if Someone Breaks into Your Home While You Are Alone,Attempt a fish-hook.,"Attempt a fish-hook. Curve your finger and hook the inside of your opponent's mouth, pulling as far as you can.

If you see an aerosol lying around, or if you own pepper spray, pick it up and spray it in your opponent's eyes. They should stumble back, so a jab to the gut or kick in the calf should finish the move and injure them greatly.

How to Defend Yourself if Someone Breaks into Your Home While You Are Alone,Smash their head.,"Smash their head. If you are near a wall, you should back up your opponent into it. Punch them in the gut swiftly and this should wind them enough to enable you to grasp their head and push it with force against the wall.

How to Defend Yourself if Someone Breaks into Your Home While You Are Alone,Threaten them with a licensed fire-arm if you have one.,"Threaten them with a licensed fire-arm if you have one. If you live in the United States, it is possible that you have a registered and licensed gun in your possession. Try to find this if you own one. It is not advisable to shoot unless the other party, also, are armed, due to the legal implications. The damage you do in self-defence must be thought appropriate for the situation - for example, if you are up against an unarmed intruder who lacks in muscle, then yes the law still protects you, but your plea of self defence would be compromised by the fact that a gun would not have been necessary to conquer your opponent. Any damage you do must be enough to protect you, no more than this, so strongly evaluate the situation before jumping right in and firing shots. [8] X Research source"

Consequently, if you can leave the room in a safe and orderly manner, you should find a nook or cranny to wait in. This should be out of the way, but somewhere you genuinely think they'll walk past. As they walk past, you have to make an extremely bold move that would not be suggested unless your situation was life-threatening, or you were being pursued. Wait until they're just about to walk past your hiding place, and put them in a headlock from behind. Use two hands - this is not usual, but they might be able to escape if your grip is not secure. Then, wrestle the gun from them. You don't necessarily have to pull the trigger if this troubles you greatly, but keeping the gun safely out of your opponent's way should make you feel safer."
How to Defend Yourself if Someone Breaks into Your Home While You Are Alone,Attempt a 'melee' attack.,"Attempt a 'melee' attack. If they do not know your whereabouts, but are actively pursuing you, it might be an idea to 'melee' them. Do this by waiting until their back is turned for you - perhaps if they are walking through the hallway or peering into a room to find you. You should find a sharp or heavy object. Sneak up on them as stealthily as possible, holding your breath, and hit their head from behind. This should alarm them, and buy you time to wrestle the gun from them and run."

Everybody should know the best parts of the body to hit in what situation.[9] X Research source The eyes. Gouging, poking or scratching your opponent's eyes is very effective as not only does it hurt them but it impairs their vision, giving you an escape opportunity. Do this if you are extremely close to your partner - it is not a move worth performing if there is a gap between the two of you. The nose. Contrary to popular belief, the best time to target the nose is when you are directly in front of or diagonal to your partner, no gap between you. Go for a smack aimed upwards, throwing your entire body into the move. This will force an opponent to loosen their grip on you, and cause immense discomfort. If you are being pursued by an opponent (so they are behind you), elbow their nose or strike a side punch. The neck. The side of the neck is a perfect target if you want to hurt the opposition, but not cause too much damage. Stunning the attacker with a knife-hand strike (whereby your hand is flat as if to slap them, but horizontal) to the throat or even elbow the throat of the assailant for maximum damage. The knee. The knee is an easy target because it cannot be defended with fists and is vulnerable from every angle. Kick the side of the knee with vigor to harm and cause your partner to stagger. A kick to the front of the knee would also do the trick, but is less likely to cause an imbalance. Below the ear. A strike to the area just below the ear will cause severe damage when performed correctly. This can cause death to the partner if executed too strongly, so be very wary. The throat. Take your palm upwards to their nose, which will push their head backwards. This leaves their throat exposed. You can use this opportunity to punch their adam's apple or bash in their neck."

How to Defend Yourself if Someone Breaks into Your Home While You Are Alone,Get to grips with your side kick.,"Get to grips with your side kick. If there are multiple people attacking you want to shake them all off, fast, before they dominate you. A side kick to the stomach of someone harming you might be your last hope. To execute it right, simply bring up the leg on the side of the person you plan on kicking, jab them whilst sliding your opposite foot back slightly, and aim as high as possible. This should cause a definite stumble, which may leave a gap in their attack."
How to Defend Yourself if Someone Breaks into Your Home While You Are Alone,Use your elbows.,"Use your elbows. You may be a whirl of arms and legs when being attacked by more than one person, but that's okay, as long as you are being effective.

As animalistic and disturbing as this may be, it could completely shock them. And sometimes the element of surprise is what will buy you time, or eventually, win you the fight.

In most cases, if a baby bird is featherless or still very fuzzy, it probably needs to be hand-fed, since its mother would likely still feed it in the wild. However, once its flight feathers start coming in, thicken its formula or mash a little so the baby bird can get used to tasting and processing slightly more solid food. For instance, if youre making mash out of dog or cat food thats been soaked in water, you might add in 1-2 pieces of food that havent been soaked quite as long, so they retain a little of their texture. You can also buy commercial weaning pellets from a pet supply store. These pellets are nutritionally designed for baby birds.[4] X Research source This mimics how birds eat in the wild.

A blanket can work too, but do not use anything that is unclean. Clean maxi pads or adult diapers are also quite effective for larger amputations Do not moisten the material with anything other than saline solution or clean water. Wrapping the limb in a clean, dry material is better than using any unclean liquid to moisten the material. Paper towel will work if you do not have gauze or a clean cloth.

Be sure to wrap the limb entirely and tie the handles of the bag tightly together. If you have tape or string, use it to ensure the seal. Use a tarp. While a tarp is waterproof, creating a reliable seal will be a challenge. Don't wrap the limb with too many layers of tarp, or you will not be able to cool the limb. Use tape and rope or whatever is available to tie the tarp snugly around the limb with as best a seal as you can create. Use plastic wrap. An initial layer of plastic wrap around the gauze or cloth is great, but another method of creating a water seal should be used if possible. Remember not to wrap the limb too tightly, as this may damage the tissue. Label the limb with the patients name and the time it was removed from the injured person's body.

If the wrap is not watertight, do not submerge the limb in an ice bath or cold water. Instead, place the limb on ice in a cooler or other vessel, making sure that some sort of material insulates the limb from direct contact with the ice.[9] X Research source Never use dry ice. Cold water can be used in lieu of an ice bath, but cleanliness is extremely important. Do not use water from a natural source for a cold bath unless you are sure you have a watertight seal around the limb. If a cold source is unavailable, keep the part away from any source of heat.

How to Remove Scratches from a Phone Screen: 3 Simple Ways,Have toothpaste at the ready.,"Have toothpaste at the ready. Toothpaste should already be a standard part of your medicine cabinet and morning routine. Designed to be abrasive, toothpaste can fix a plastic scratch the same way it cleans teeth. Because it is home-based and shouldn't require additional purchases, toothpaste is the recommended remedy for fixing plastic scratches. It's important to make sure the toothpaste is an actual paste, as opposed to a gel-based toothpaste.[1] X Research source In order for the scratch to work, the toothpaste needs to be abrasive. Check your toothpaste box if you're unsure about the kind of toothpaste you are using. A baking soda mixture has the same abrasive qualities as toothpaste. If you'd rather use baking soda, you can stir up a paste with two parts baking soda and one part water. Use it in the same manner."

Any more will create an unwieldy mess on your phone."
How to Remove Scratches from a Phone Screen: 3 Simple Ways,Apply toothpaste to the scratch.,"Apply toothpaste to the scratch. Once you've got your dab of toothpaste, rub it around in a gentle, circular motion. Continue doing this until the scratch is barely noticeable. Since the toothpaste is abrasive on its own, you won't need to apply too much pressure. Keep at the scrubbing until you start to see progress. Even if the scratch is too significant to be done away with entirely, the abrasion should reduce the scratch. If your scratch is significant enough, toothpaste won't be enough to fix it. Even so, it should at least reduce the look of most scratches. If the scratches are severe, you can protect the cracked screen until you're able to get it replaced. You can also protect a curved phone screen."
How to Remove Scratches from a Phone Screen: 3 Simple Ways,Clean your phone.,"Clean your phone. Once the scratch is reduced to your liking, it's a simple process of cleaning off the toothpaste. Taking a soft, slightly damp cloth and wiping away the excess toothpaste is a good start. From there, you should take a polishing cloth and wipe away any dirt or oils that have otherwise built up on your screen. By doing this, you'll renew the look of your phone, and hopefully make your phone look better than even before the scratch. Some methods may worsen your scratches or fail to improve them, such as: coconut oil, petroleum jelly, and powdered cleansers. Beware of these methods. If the damage worsens, you will need to fix your phone screen."
How to Remove Scratches from a Phone Screen: 3 Simple Ways,Purchase a cerium oxide polish.,"Purchase a cerium oxide polish. If your phone has a glass screen (instead of a plastic one) you'll have to use a more heavy-duty solution than toothpaste or baking soda to get scratches off your phone. In this case, a cerium oxide polish is recommended. This type of polish can be bought as a soluble powder, or in a pre-mixed form. While the pre-mixed polish is obviously the more convenient option, you'll get much better value if you buy it in its powdered form. 100g of cerium oxide powder should be more than enough when it comes to polishing your phone screen. You may want to buy a larger amount in the event of future scratching."

If you bought powdered cerium oxide, you'll first need to prep the mix yourself. Luckily, this is very easy, and likely worth the money you'll be saving. Pour some powder (approx. 50-100g) into a small container. Slowly add water until the solution has the consistency of dairy cream. Mix regularly as you add the water in order to make sure your measurements are correct. Measurements don't have to be perfect in the case of this polish, so long as you make sure there's enough water for the polish to soak into an applicator. This step can be disregarded completely if you buy a pre-mixed polish."
How to Remove Scratches from a Phone Screen: 3 Simple Ways,Block off all vulnerable spots with tape.,"Block off all vulnerable spots with tape. A cerium oxide polish will do a number on your device if it seeps into any of the phone's holes, including the speaker, headphone jack or charger input. It can also potentially endanger your phone's cam lens. With that in mind, you should first cordon off the area you'd like to have polished with tape. Cover up whatever parts of your phone that might have problems if they're touched by the polish. Taping up your phone before cleaning may seem overzealous, but it's highly recommended you follow through with this step before proceeding forward. In the case of a foul-up, your phone can be quickly wrecked otherwise."
How to Remove Scratches from a Phone Screen: 3 Simple Ways,Apply the polish to the scratched area.,"Apply the polish to the scratched area. Dab a smooth polishing cloth in your cerium oxide mix, and rub the scratched area in a vigorous, circular motion. Regularly check to see how the scratch is looking as you tend the area. Every 30 seconds or so, it's a good idea to wipe away the mix with the opposite end of your cloth, dab the cloth in new polish, and repeat the process for maximum effectiveness. When applying an abrasive polish, you'll want to go harder with the application than if you were simply cleaning it. Make sure not to go too hard, however. There would be nothing worse than causing new cracks in the screen while you're trying to fix old ones."
How to Remove Scratches from a Phone Screen: 3 Simple Ways,Give your phone a follow-up clean.,"Give your phone a follow-up clean. Once you've applied and cleaned off the polish, it won't hurt to give your phone a quick once-over with a polishing cloth. This will wipe away any excess debris caused by the polish process. Remove the tape you added before polishing and wipe your phone. It doesn't need to take more than a minute or two to do thoroughly, but you may be impressed how much nicer your phone looks once you've wiped away the excess muck.

How to Grow Mushrooms (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Purchase oyster mushroom spawn.,"Purchase oyster mushroom spawn. Oyster mushrooms are the easiest to grow, and a great choice for novices. To get started, buy them online, in a home gardening store, or in a homebrew supply store in the form of ""spawn"": spores or root-like mycelium stored in sawdust, grain, or agar. You can buy the spawn alone or as part of a complete oyster mushroom kit.[1] X Research source Any oyster mushroom variety will work, but blue grey oysters and pink oysters are especially easy and quick to grow.[2] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Growing outdoors? ""Plug spawn"" is a slow but even easier alternative. Just drill holes in the side of a newly fallen hardwood log (avoid softwood or pine because they will inhibit the growth of fungus), insert the plugs, and wait for damp weather.[3] X Research source"
How to Grow Mushrooms (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Make a pasteurized substrate.,"Make a pasteurized substrate. If your kit came with a large bag of straw, that's a ready-to-go substrate, or material that provides nutrients and a place to grow. If you only have a small container of mushroom spawn, you'll need to make your own substrate, and heat it so only beneficial microbes can grow. Here are two ways to make a substrate: Cardboard:[4] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source Best for spawn in sawdust[5] X Research source 1.

How to Grow Mushrooms (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Add the spawn to the substrate.,"Add the spawn to the substrate. This is called ""inoculation."" To minimize competition from other spores, wash your hands first and inoculate as soon as the substrate is ready: Mushroom kit with included substrate: Sterilize a syringe and inject spawn into the grow bag through the small hole, or into the tray of substrate at several points. Cardboard substrate: Stack the cardboard squares inside a food-grade plastic bag. Sprinkle a little spawn between each layer as you stack. (Break up the spawn by hand if it's in a solid clump.)[9] X Research source Homemade straw substrate: Wipe a table with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Spread the straw out on the table and break up the spawn over it, mixing thoroughly. Transfer to food-grade plastic bags until they are full but not compressed.[10] X Research source There's no exact ratio of spawn to substrate, but you can start with a mix that is 2 or 3% spawn by weight. Adding more spawn helps the colony grow faster and resist contamination.[11] X Research source"
How to Grow Mushrooms (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Poke holes in the bag.,"Poke holes in the bag. Tie the top of the plastic bag closed. Punch holes into the sides of the bag every 3 inches or so (7.5 cm), plus a few more in the base to allow for water drainage. The mushrooms need ventilation to grow quickly and reliably, or carbon dioxide build-up will prevent fruiting. Most bags included in mushroom kits already have holes, or an air filter system that makes holes unnecessary."
How to Grow Mushrooms (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Choose a location with a steady temperature.,"Choose a location with a steady temperature. Now the spawn is ready to colonize the substrate with mycelium. Most strains do this best at temperatures between 60 and 75F (1624C).[12] X Research source Even small variations in temperature can decrease mushroom yield or encourage contamination, so try to find a room that stays at this temperature 24 hours a day.[13] X Research source Mycelium can grow at any light level except direct sunlight. Some growers find they get better results with low light on a daylight cycle (real or simulated). However, if you are using straw, too much light can cause grain to sprout and interfere with mushroom growth. The ideal temperature depends on the strain. If your spawn came with instructions for a growing environment, follow them."
How to Grow Mushrooms (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Check on moisture levels over the next few weeks.,"Check on moisture levels over the next few weeks. It takes two to five weeks for the white, feathery ""roots"" called mycelium to spread throughout the substrate. During this time, all you need to do is check on the moisture level every few days. If the substrate feels dry to the touch, mist it through the holes in the bag. If you see standing water inside the bag, poke more drainage holes in the base.[14] X Research source Mycelium is white. If you see large patches of another color, mold has contaminated the bag.[15] X Research source Throw the bag away and wipe the area down with isopropyl alcohol before trying again."
How to Grow Mushrooms (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Move the bag to a fruiting environment.,"Move the bag to a fruiting environment. Once the mycelium has formed a thick mat inside the bag, it is ready to fruit (produce mushrooms). The fungus has different needs for this stage, so move it to a new location and follow these instructions: Mushrooms will not fruit without light. Provide at least enough to read by during daylight hours.[16] X Research source Use indirect daylight, a grow light that mimics daylight, or (less effective but cheaper) a cool white bulb.[17] X Research source The fungus needs fresh air to clear out carbon dioxide, which prevents fruiting or leads to small mushrooms. Open the top of the bag and ventilate the area with a light cross breeze. Lower the temperature, ideally to 5561F (1316C). Increase humidity to at least 80%, ideally to 9095%, by running a humidifier or hanging plastic sheets around the grow bag. This part doesn't have to be perfect, but other conditions can affect the yield, shape, and color of your mushrooms."
How to Grow Mushrooms (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Water lightly.,"Water lightly. Over- and under-watering are common problems at this stage. To prevent drying without soaking the mushrooms, lightly spray the inner walls of the bag once or twice a day.[18] X Trustworthy Source EDIS Electronic database of the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences's peer-reviewed articles Go to source If the growing mushrooms turn brown, or new mushrooms start to grow on an older mushroom's surface, the substrate is probably too dry.

How to Grow Mushrooms (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Pick the mushrooms as they grow to full size.,"Pick the mushrooms as they grow to full size. Mushrooms start as tiny ""pins,"" then grow rapidly over the next few days if conditions are right. Once they have reached full size, press down on the substrate with one hand, then use the other to twist the stalk off at the base. You may eat them immediately or dry them for later use. If you're not sure what a fully developed oyster mushroom looks like, wait until the edges of the first mushroom go wavy. This is slightly past optimal harvesting point, but still edible. Pick the other mushrooms just before they reach the size of the first.[19] X Research source Tiny, aborted mushrooms are common in some strains. Leave them in place without picking them."

How to Grow Mushrooms (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Experiment with other mushroom varieties.,"Experiment with other mushroom varieties. The basic process for growing oyster mushrooms works for most mushroom species, but you will need to make adjustments. When you buy spawn, check the instructions or ask the seller for the following information so you can adjust your approach: Preferred substrate (some species need a specially prepared compost) Ideal temperature during colonization Ideal temperature and humidity levels during fruiting (mushroom growth)Lion's mane, lingzhi, shiitake, enoki, and nameko mushrooms are all good choices for a second project, only a bit more difficult than oyster mushrooms."
How to Grow Mushrooms (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Keep conditions clean.,"Keep conditions clean. If mold or other contaminants take over your substrate, that batch of mushrooms will be unusable. Most mushroom species are not as resistant to contamination as oyster mushrooms are, so it pays to spend more effort keeping the area clean: Wash your hands with antibacterial soap before handling any part of the operation. Take special care to pasteurize your substrate. If stovetop heating becomes impractical, look into a steam room or chemical treatment. Treating a compost substrate is complex, and may require help from an experienced grower."
How to Grow Mushrooms (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Cover the substrate with a casing.,"Cover the substrate with a casing. ""Casing"" is a layer of sterile material on top of a tray of substrate, usually a mixture of peat moss and ground limestone. Keep the casing moist so water gradually leaches through to the substrate, without making the substrate soggy. Not all types of spawn need casing. Ask the seller or an experienced grower for advice. Do not ventilate the area until the tiny ""pins"" have appeared on the surface of the casing. Ventilating too early will trigger fruiting before the pins have broken through, growing mushrooms underneath the casing."
How to Grow Mushrooms (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Take control over growing conditions.,"Take control over growing conditions. Tracking and controlling temperature and humidity will improve your mushroom harvests, and help you improve your setup with each attempt. If you get serious about a mushroom growing hobby, prepare a room with fans or an air duct for ventilation, plus a heating system and/or air conditioner to control temperature. Record temperature and humidity changes using a thermometer and hygrometer.[20] X Research source Temperature can vary significantly between the ceiling and floor of a room. If you're growing on multiple shelves, put a thermometer at each level. Strong drafts can be fatal to some mushroom types. Protect the spawn from direct wind."
How to Grow Mushrooms (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Get rid of substrate after a harvest.,"Get rid of substrate after a harvest. If you plan on growing more mushrooms in the same room, pasteurize your substrate again to get rid of mold and bacteria that might contaminate the room. With a compost substrate, this can take 824 hours of steaming at around 150F (70C). Although the substrate is low in nutrients for mushrooms, you can use it as garden compost or mulch for newly planted lawns. Spent substrate has a high concentration of salt, which some plants are sensitive to. Leaving it outdoors to ""weather"" for six months should remove this problem."
How to Grow Mushrooms (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Make your own mushroom spawn.,"Make your own mushroom spawn. Instead of buying spawn each time, you could grow your own from spores. This is a difficult and complicated task, but there are many free resources that can guide you. (Try contacting a mycological association in your area). One way to create a spawn culture is to make a spore print. Transfer the spores to a petri dish of agar using an inoculation loop, as described here (though you do not need to draw a T pattern). Repeat with several petri dishes, since some may fail to germinate.[21] X Research source A mostly sterile environment is a necessity for making spawn. Before you begin, remove all rugs and curtains that could trap dust. Clean all surfaces with mild disinfectant, including the ceiling. Cover all openings with plastic sheeting, and make an ""antechamber"" at the entrance with a second layer of plastic.[22] X Research source"

3 Ways to Build a Deck - wikiHow,Lay down the deck boards.,"Lay down the deck boards. Measure the deck frame from the outside edge of one rim joist to the outside edge of the other and add the width of any skirting or length of any overhang to it. Cut the first two deck boards to this length, then cut off the length of any overhang from the board that will be laid next to the house. (Subsequent boards need not be cut to this length, but can be laid down first and cut flush with the first two boards later.) Set the first board against the house sheathing and the next board against it if wet and the width of a 16-penny nail apart from it if dry. Attach the boards to the joists with two nails or screws. Straighten the boards as you go with a flat bar.[14] X Research source If you're building a wide deck, you can cut multiple deck boards to span the distance between the rim joists, with the places where two boards meet falling in the middle of a joist. Stagger these joints between each row of decking to make the deck look nicer. Periodically measure the distance from the front of the deck to each end of the last board laid. They should be equal; if not, decrease the gaps between boards slightly on the longer side and increase them slightly on the shorter side until the distances are equal again. If the last deck board is wider than the space to lay it, either narrow it or use a narrower board of the same type of decking material. If the board is narrower than the space available, take a wider board and narrow it as necessary."
3 Ways to Build a Deck - wikiHow,"Build stairs, if necessary.","Build stairs, if necessary. If your deck is high enough to require stairs, determine the number of steps you'll need by dividing the deck height in feet by seven. If the quotient is a whole number, use the quotient as the number of steps, with a rise of 7 inches (17.5 centimeters). If the quotient includes a fraction, round to the nearest whole number to get the number of steps and divide that number into the deck height to get the rise in inches. Divide the rise into 75 to get the approximate length for each step.[15] X Research source You'll need to have a stringer at either end of the staircase to attach the steps to and another stringer in the center if you have a wide or tall staircase. Lay the first stringer out with a framing square to find the rise and run, then transfer the marks to the other stringers. Cut out the step supports, then brace the stringers together and nail them to the deck's rim joist before securing them permanently with lag screws. Cut the steps to have a 3/4-inch (1.9-centimeter) overhang to either side of the stringer assembly to channel rain away from the stringers. Attach them to the stringers with screws or nails."

Begin by installing the corner and stair posts, plumbing them and securing them first with glue, then with either lag screws or carriage bolts. The remaining piecestop rails, bottom rails and spindlesmay be attached individually or assembled into sections and then installed as units.[16] X Research source Measure the distance between posts to find the length of the rails and cut them to that length. Vertical spindles usually need to be spaced to no more than 4 inches (10 centimeters) apart and should be placed closer together if it will create even spacing over the entire deck.[17] X Research source They can be attached to the rails with nails or screws, while the rails themselves attach to the posts with angle screws. (Use wooden blocks to prop up the rail sections while screwing them in.) Cut the stair posts to the correct height and angle with the help of a framing square, then install the bottom stair rails and hand rails. Figure the length of the stair rails by dividing the stair rise by the run, multiplying by the deck rail length, squaring the result, adding the square of the deck rail length and take the square root of the result. Cut the spindles to the right length, angled for the slope of the rail and install as described above for the deck spindles."

How to Recognize the Signs and Symptoms of Tuberculosis,Beware of areas that leave you vulnerable to TB.,"Beware of areas that leave you vulnerable to TB. If you live in or have traveled to these areas, or even if you come into contact with someone else who has, you could be at risk. In many parts of the world, the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of TB is a challenge due to health care policy, financial/resource constraints, or overpopulation. This allows TB to go undetected and untreated, causing it to spread. Traveling on an airplane to and from these areas can also harbor the bacteria due to isolated ventilation.

How to Recognize the Signs and Symptoms of Tuberculosis,Notice any unusual coughing.,"Notice any unusual coughing. TB usually infects the lungs, breaking down the tissue there. Our body's natural response is to remove the irritant by coughing. Figure out how long you've been coughing; TB usually lasts for more than 3 weeks and may include such worrisome signs as bloody sputum. Consider how long you've taken over the counter cold/flu medications or antibiotics for a respiratory infection with no relief. TB needs very specific antibacterial drugs, and to start therapy requires screening and confirming TB."
How to Recognize the Signs and Symptoms of Tuberculosis,Look for discharge when coughing.,"Look for discharge when coughing. Have you noticed any sputum (sticky discharge) when coughing? If it smells and is dark, it can be any type of bacterial infection. If it's clear and odorless, it can be a viral infection. Take notice if there's been any blood when coughing into your hands or tissues. When TB cavities and nodules form, nearby blood vessels may get destroyed, leading to hemoptysis  coughing up blood.

How to Recognize the Signs and Symptoms of Tuberculosis,"Do not ignore fever, chills and night sweats.","Do not ignore fever, chills and night sweats. Bacteria usually reproduce at around normal body temperature (98.6 F, 37.0 C). The brain and immune system respond by raising the body's temperature to stop the bug from reproducing. The rest of the body detects this change, then attempts to adjust to this new temperature by contracting muscles (shivers), making you feel chills. TB also causes specific inflammatory proteins that aid in fever production to be produced.[7] X Research source Dall L., Stanford J.F. 1990. Fever, Chills, and Night Sweats.

How to Recognize the Signs and Symptoms of Tuberculosis,Be able to distinguish TB from other respiratory infections.,"Be able to distinguish TB from other respiratory infections. There are many other conditions that TB could be mistaken for. You don't want to wait out a simple cold virus only to find out that you have something more serious on your hands. To differentiate between TB and other conditions, ask yourself the following questions: Is there clear mucus liquid dripping from my nose? A cold will cause congestion/inflammation of the nose and lungs that leads to mucus dripping or running out from the nose. TB will not present with a runny nose. What is being produced by my coughing? Viral infections and the flu tend to have a dry cough or produce a white mucus. Bacterial infections found in the lower respiratory tract produce brownish sputum. TB, though, typically produces a cough over 3 weeks and can produce a hallmark bloody sputum. Am I sneezing? TB does not cause sneezing. This is usually a sign of the cold or flu. Do I have a fever? TB can cause a fever of all levels, but those who have the flu typically have fevers of more than 100.4 F (38.0 C). Do my eyes appear watery/itchy? The cold typically presents with these symptoms, but not TB. Do I have a headache? The flu typically presents with headaches. Do I have joint and/or body aches? The cold and flu can cause this but it is more severe with the flu. Do I have a sore throat?Look inside your throat and see if it appears red, swollen and painful when swallowing. This is seen mainly with cold but can appear with the flu as well."
How to Recognize the Signs and Symptoms of Tuberculosis,Know when to seek immediate medical attention.,"Know when to seek immediate medical attention. Certain signs and symptoms require immediate help. Even if these TB symptoms don't result in a TB diagnosis, they might point to other severe illness. Many conditions, both harmless and dangerous, can cause chest pain, but you should always report it and allow a doctor to perform an EKG exam. Consistent weight loss might indicate malnutrition or cancer. When combined with bloody cough, weight loss can more specifically suggest lung cancer. High fever and chills can also be caused by an underlying blood infection or sepsis, though this usually causes a drop in blood pressure, dizziness, delirium and high heart rate.[8] X Research source If left untreated, it can be potentially deadly, or lead to severe dysfunction. The doctors will order IV antibiotics and blood work looking at the white blood cells (immune cells that fight infection). It can be difficult to know how to care for someone experiencing delirium, but by taking time to better understand the condition you can avoid common mistakes."

How to Make Pot Liners for Plants: 7 Steps (with Pictures),Choose your pot liner material.,"Choose your pot liner material. The most common materials are plastic and fabric, such as burlap. Smaller plants can even use coffee filters. The material you use simply depends on the size of the pot youre lining and what material you have at your disposal. Look around your house for material you can repurpose into pot liners. Plastic milk gallons, bottles, and similar items can be great pot liners. You can cut off the spout, wash out the inside, and nestle the body of the jug or bottle into a similarly sized pot. You must use a material that you can poke holes in. It is critical that water can drain from your pot liner."
How to Make Pot Liners for Plants: 7 Steps (with Pictures),Measure the liner against the pot.,"Measure the liner against the pot. In other words, place your liner within the planter and use a writing utensil to mark the places youll need to cut or trim. For example, if you are using a piece of burlap, place it within the planter and mark where the burlap extends beyond the rim of the planter. If youre using an old plastic carton, mark where youll cut the plastic so that it nestles discreetly into the pot.[1] X Research source The liner can fit all the way to the bottom of your planter, but it doesn't have to. If you have a very deep pot, you might not want to fill the entire thing with soil. If you create a pot liner that is sturdy and strong enough to hold your soil and plant, you can always try creating one that hangs from the rim of the planter without actually going all the way to the bottom. The planter or pot will appear to be completely full, but only the liner will actually be full. If the liner doesn't reach the bottom of the pot, you can also place rocks or packing peanuts in the pot."
How to Make Pot Liners for Plants: 7 Steps (with Pictures),Trim your liner.,"Trim your liner. Typically, you will want to cut it so that its not easily visible, and it appears that the plant is directly placed in the decorative pot or planter. However, you should leave enough material so that you can grasp it when you need to pull out the liner from the pot. Using sharp scissors, cut the liner material along the marks you made against the planter. Place it in the pot, and double check if you need to trim again. If youre using a fabric liner, such as burlap, try letting the liner show for a decorative, rustic look. You can leave excess material on either side of the liner so that they act almost as handles when you need to pull the liner out of the planter or pot. Just make sure that you practice pulling the liner out of the vessel a couple times before you fill it with heavy soil. You need enough material to get a sturdy grasp."
How to Make Pot Liners for Plants: 7 Steps (with Pictures),Cut drainage holes in the bottom of the liner.,"Cut drainage holes in the bottom of the liner. The holes should be dispersed evenly along the bottom of the liner, and they should be big enough just to let water drain out but not so big that you are losing chunks of soil every time you move the pot. That will defeat the purpose of your liner! The drainage holes are absolutely crucial for healthy plants. If the roots are constantly soaked, they cannot get the air they need. Plants often die from sitting in stagnant pools of water and developing rot. Whether youre using plastic, fabric, of filters, you must cut or poke holes into the bottom. This is another huge benefit of using pot liners. When youre planting in a pot or planter that does not have drainage holes, the pot liner will allow you to lift the plant out of the pot, let the roots drain properly, and place it back into the pot."
How to Make Pot Liners for Plants: 7 Steps (with Pictures),Fill your liner with potting soil.,"Fill your liner with potting soil. The potting soil you use will depend on the plant.

Look for ones that specifically contain peat moss, pine bark, and perlite or vermiculite.[2] X Research source Fill the pot about half way before placing the plant. It is important to buy soils that are specifically for potting. Things like garden soil and mulch were not created for planting in containers. Leave two or three inches between the top of the soil and the lip of the pot."
How to Make Pot Liners for Plants: 7 Steps (with Pictures),Place your plant in the soil.,"Place your plant in the soil.

How to Install Fencing (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Check building codes.,"Check building codes. Contact your local municipality or homeowner association to ask about codes, restrictions, and permits relevant to your project. It's also wise to discuss the project with your neighbors. If the fence is on an adjoining property line, you may be able to split the costs 50/50."
How to Install Fencing (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Measure the area to be fenced.,"Measure the area to be fenced. Depending on the size and shape of the area in which you're installing fencing, you'll need to figure out how much fencing you'll need to enclose the given space. If you just want a decorative fence, measure the length of the side of your yard you want to fence. If you want an enclosed fence, measure the total area and the length of each side. If you want a prefabricated fence, measure a single panel before buying. Mark off this distance along your planned fence line and stake the position of each fence panel. You'll end up setting fence posts at each stake, aligning them with the twine line and mounding soil around them above ground level."
How to Install Fencing (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Locate and mark all buried utility lines.,Locate and mark all buried utility lines. Call the local utilities companies to determine the locations of your lines if you aren't sure. Do not dig anything until the utility company representatives have identified and marked all the buried lines. You can also call 811 in some areas to get information about power lines.
How to Install Fencing (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Buy an appropriate amount of fencing for the space.,"Buy an appropriate amount of fencing for the space. Take your measurements to the hardware store and purchase fencing that suits your tastes and your needs. Larger wooden fences might need to be cut from scratch, while prefabricated fences are available in a wide variety of styles and methods of installation. If you're buying a pre-fabricated fence, take your measurements to the store and shop around for possibilities."
How to Install Fencing (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Acquire fence posts.,"Acquire fence posts. If you want to cut your own fence posts, you'll need wood that will hold up underground. This can be wood rated for direct ground contact, pressure-treated wood which has been injected with preservative, or wood coated with wood preservative at home (as described below). Gate posts and corner posts are usually larger than the rest."
How to Install Fencing (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Stain the fence posts and panels.,"Stain the fence posts and panels. Before installing the fence, you'll need to complete any staining and painting that you'd like on the wood. It'll be easier to do this before you put it together. This should definitely be done on fence posts that you're cutting yourself, and also possibly on pre-fab models that are untreated. Brush the posts and fencing panels with oil-based wood stain. Wipe off excess stain and allow everything to dry completely."
How to Install Fencing (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Apply wood preservative to fence posts.,"Apply wood preservative to fence posts. If the wood is not pressure-treated, paint the fence posts with copper naphthenate or another wood preservative to one-third of their height and allow them to dry thoroughly, following the manufacturer's instructions. This hinders rot from the contact with the damp soil and the underground sections of the posts. Treat all cut ends with preservative as well. Alternatively, you can paint on just the below-ground portions in advance, to reduce mess during installation. Treat the rest with an airless sprayer once the fence is complete. Follow all safety instructions on the preservative label. Copper naphthenate can irritate skin, eyes, and lungs."
How to Install Fencing (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Place a stake at the location for each corner fence post.,"Place a stake at the location for each corner fence post. Whatever kind of fence you're installing, it's a good idea to mark each corner of the fenced-in area with stakes. At each corner, plant a small wooden stake to mark the spot clearly."
How to Install Fencing (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Dig a hole for the first post at the corner of the fence.,"Dig a hole for the first post at the corner of the fence. To get started, you'll need to start installing the fence posts, which will form the corners of the fence. Dig a hole that is twice the diameter of the post and one-third of the height of the post, using a posthole digger. Make the bottom of the hole slightly larger than the top to make sure you'll be able to seat it properly and securely. It's a good idea to place the dirt you remove on a tarp, so you'll be able to keep it in an even pile for putting it back in and securing the post. Remove any large rocks and roots from the hole. If necessary, cut large roots free. If youre going to be digging a lot of holes or setting a lot of posts, consider renting a gas-powered hole digger. This machine requires a strong helper and close attention to safety precautions to avoid injury."
How to Install Fencing (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Install some gravel.,"Install some gravel. Add 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) of gravel to the hole, spreading it evenly across the bottom. This allows proper drainage away from the fence posts during inclement weather, extending the life of the fence itself. Pea-sized landscaping gravel, often just called ""pea gravel"" is usually the most affordable and effective type of gravel for the job."
How to Install Fencing (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Seat the first fence post.,"Seat the first fence post. Set a corner or end post into the hole, and add 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) of soil. Check the level of the fence post by placing a carpenter's level on at least 2 sides. When the fence post is level, tamp the soil to compact it solidly into the hole. Add another 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) of soil, check the level and tamp the soil. Repeat until you have filled the hole completely. Instead of filling the holes back up with soil, you can mix up a small batch of concrete and use that to fill in above the gravel. For an even easier time, theres a variety of concrete specifically for fence posts, which can be added dry to the hole and soaked with a hose to allow it to set up quickly and easily. Brace the post plumb before filling by using 1"" x 4"" boards (4' to 6' long), staking, and screws or duplex nails."
How to Install Fencing (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Build a mound at the bottom of the fence post.,"Build a mound at the bottom of the fence post. Mound dirt around the fence post at ground level, rounding it with a trowel, if you filled in around the post with soil. This will direct rain and snow melt away from the fence post, as well as help to secure the post in the ground. If you do use concrete, you still want to have a gentle slope away from the post. Fill it halfway with concrete and ensure that the post is still level when you install. Let the concrete cure properly, then fill the rest of the hole with dirt."
How to Install Fencing (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Set the height between the fence posts with twine.,"Set the height between the fence posts with twine. In most pre-fab kits, twine is used to connect the fence posts to the stakes and make sure that everything will be installed at an even height to match the fencing panels. If you're installing your own fencing, you can use the same technique. Tie twine to a corner or end post, about 6 inches (15 cm) from the ground. Stretch the twine taut to the position of the next corner or end post. Affix it to a stake at the same height to use as a reference."
How to Install Fencing (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Repeat with the rest of the posts.,"Repeat with the rest of the posts. Set the corner and end posts first, using your twine as a height reference. Continue on, repeating the steps above until you've installed all the fence posts. Before seating each one, double-check the precise distance between posts with a tape measure."
How to Install Fencing (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Connect the first two fence posts.,"Connect the first two fence posts. Depending on what kind of fence you're installing, you might need to either install a cross-beam to provide yourself something to attach individual fence panels onto, or you might just set up the large piece of fence paneling and slot it into the fence posts. Each fence will be different, so you'll need to proceed according to your own plans for the fence if you're making your own, or following the directions of the fence kit you purchased. If you're cutting your own panels or fence slats, install cross-beams with wood-screws between each set of fence posts.

How to Make a Punnett Square: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Draw a 2 x 2 square.,"Draw a 2 x 2 square. Draw a box and divide it into four smaller squares. Leave room above the box and to its left, so you can label it. Review the background information below if you have trouble understanding any of the steps that follow."
How to Make a Punnett Square: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Name the alleles involved.,"Name the alleles involved. Each Punnett square describes how variations of a gene (alleles) could be inherited if two organisms sexually reproduce. Choose a letter to represent the alleles. Write the dominant allele with any capital letter, and the recessive allele with the same letter in lowercase. It doesn't matter which letter you choose.[1] X Research source For example, call the dominant gene for black fur ""F"", and the recessive gene for yellow fur ""f"". If you don't know which gene is dominant, use different letters for the two alleles."
How to Make a Punnett Square: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Check the parents' genotypes.,"Check the parents' genotypes. Next, we need to know the genotype each parent has for that trait. Each parent has two alleles (sometimes the same one) for the trait, just like every sexual organism, so their genotype will be two letters long. Sometimes, you'll already know exactly what this genotype is. Other times, you'll have to work it out from other information:[2] X Research source ""Heterozygous"" means it has two different alleles (Ff). ""Homozygous dominant"" means it has two copies of the dominant allele (FF). ""Homozygous recessive"" means it has two copies of the recessive allele (ff). Any parent that shows the recessive trait (has yellow fur) belongs to this category."
How to Make a Punnett Square: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Label the rows with one parent's genotype.,"Label the rows with one parent's genotype. Pick one parent  traditionally the female (mother), but either will work.[3] X Research source Label the first row of the grid with one of that parent's allele. Label the second row of the grid with the second allele. For example, the female bear is heterozygous for fur color (Ff). Write an F to the left of the first row, and an f to the left of the second row."
How to Make a Punnett Square: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Label the columns with the other parent's genotype.,"Label the columns with the other parent's genotype. Write the second parent's genotype for the same trait as labels for the columns. This is typically the male's, or father's. For example, the male bear is homozygous recessive (ff). Write an f above each of the two columns."
How to Make a Punnett Square: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Have each box inherit letters from its row and column.,"Have each box inherit letters from its row and column. The rest of the Punnett square is easy. Start in the first box. Look at the letter to its left, and the letter above it. Write both these letters in the empty box. Repeat for the remaining three boxes. If you end up with both type of allele, it's customary to write the dominant allele first (write Ff, not fF).[4] X Research source In our example, the top left box inherits F from the mother and f from the father, to make Ff. The top right box inherits an F from the mother and f from the father, to make Ff. The bottom left box inherits an f from both parents, to make ff. The bottom right box inherits an f from both parents, to make ff."
How to Make a Punnett Square: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Interpret the Punnett square.,"Interpret the Punnett square. The Punnett square shows us the likelihood of creating offspring with certain alleles. There are four different ways the parents' alleles can combine, and all four are equally likely. This means that the combination in each box has a 25% chance to occur. If more than one box has the same result, add up these 25% chances together to get the total chance.[5] X Research source In our example, we have two boxes with Ff (heterozygous). 25% + 25% = 50%, so each offspring has a 50% chance of inheriting the Ff allele combination. The other two boxes are each ff (homozygous recessive). Each child has a 50% chance of inheriting ff genes."
How to Make a Punnett Square: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Describe the phenotype.,"Describe the phenotype. Often, you're more interested in the children's actual traits, not just what their genes are. This is easy to find in the most basic situation, which is what Punnett squares are usually used for. Add up the chance of each square with one or more dominant alleles to get the chance that the offspring expresses the dominant trait. Add up the chance of each square with two recessive alleles to get the possibility that the offspring expresses the recessive trait.[6] X Research source In this example, there are two squares with at least one F, so each offspring has a 50% chance to have black fur. There are two squares with ff, so each offspring has a 50% chance to have yellow fur. Read the problem carefully for more information about the phenotype. Many genes are more complex than this example. For example, a flower species might be red when it has the RR alleles, white when it has rr, or pink when it has Rr. In cases like this, the dominant allele is then referred to as an incomplete dominant allele."

A gene is a piece of ""genetic code"" that determines a trait in a living organism  for example, eye color. But eye color can be blue, or brown, or various other colors. These variations of the same gene are called alleles."
How to Make a Punnett Square: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Understand genotype and phenotype.,"Understand genotype and phenotype.

How to Make a Punnett Square: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Learn about gene inheritance.,"Learn about gene inheritance. In sexually reproducing organisms, including humans, each parent passes on one gene for each trait. The child keeps the genes from both parents.

How to Make a Punnett Square: 13 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Understand dominant and recessive genes.,"Understand dominant and recessive genes. The simplest genes have two alleles: one dominant and one recessive. The dominant variation shows up even if a recessive allele is also present. A biologist would say that the dominant allele is ""expressed in the phenotype.""[10] X Research source An organism with one dominant allele and one recessive allele is heterozygous dominant. These organism are also called carriers of the recessive allele, since they have the allele but don't show the trait.[11] X Research source An organism with two dominant alleles is homozygous dominant. An organism with two recessive alleles is homozygous recessive. Two alleles of the same gene that can combine to make three different colors are called incomplete dominants. An example of this are cream-dilute horses, where cc horses are red, Cc horses are a shade of gold, and CC horses are a light shade of cream."

Unless the conversation is important -- such as a work meeting -- consider letting someone else control the conversation. You may not want to do this with every conversation, but it can be a great way to teach yourself to speak only when you need to. This will help you become a better listener. You'll actively be focusing on the other person and how to keep the conversation central to them. You'll likely be surprised how much you end up learning, too. Try not to be too quiet when you're meeting a new person. The person may assume that you are strange or that you are not worth talking to.

When you interrupt someone, you demonstrate a complete lack of respect for their thoughts and feelings. Let them finish before you start on what you think. If youre not sure if you interrupted or not, just say, Im sorry. Did I interrupt? Go on. This will make them feel more appreciated, too. Take a second to consider how much you've spoken in this conversation and how much the other person has. If it's been a while since you've really chimed in with something, go ahead. No conversation is fulfilling if the other person is practically mute. But the door swings both ways  if you've been talking for a while, let the other person grab the reins.

People love talking about themselves, and if you allow them time to do it, theyll love you for it, too. Being quiet doesn't mean not talking  it means using words succinctly, asking interesting questions, and making solid points worth talking about. So don't tell yourself to shut up; just tell yourself to ask the right questions. Lets say an acquaintance of yours went skydiving.

There is a fine, fine line to this, however. People that don't talk loud enough can get very annoying. It's easy for others to get frustrated with you if they can't hear you.

This will help you see both sides of the coin and formulate a thought-out opinion. It'll provoke you to ask questions and to step back and think about the conversation you're having. This does not imply that quieter people are more understanding. It's just that when you're listening, it's easier to take in the other person's argument and to let them explain it fully. Avoid being quiet just to make other people angry. Being quiet to avoid confrontation is not helpful; it's cowardly. Make your points during an argument, but make them in a reasonable way without using a loud voice. Don't be impolite or unnecessarily curt  speak politely, but only when spoken to, and answer intelligently and not in an overly forward ""yes/no"" manner. Quiet is the goal, not impolite or snobby.

Also remember that quiet people can also do things loud people do. You can try singing, dancing, playing an instrument, etc. Remember to transition back to a quiet person when you're done. However, when your free time is spent being quiet, it'll be harder to make the transition into being louder in other situations, as quietude often sets the mood for your social interactions later.

3 Ways to Use Dr. Atkins' Diet as a Vegetarian or Vegan - wikiHow,Start at Phase 2 of Atkins 20.,"Start at Phase 2 of Atkins 20. Atkins 20 is the name now used for the traditional Atkins plan. This is known as the balancing phase, where you start to reintroduce certain carbs and foods slowly to determine the proper balance for your body.[1] X Research source Following the standard schedule, you would follow Phase 1 until you are within 15 pounds of your weight-loss goal (or for at least two weeks), then move into Phase 2 until within 10 pounds of your goal. However, because of the limitations in low-carb protein options for vegetarians, it is recommended by Atkins to start at Phase 2 because it permits more carbs. Atkins, in any phase, focuses on Net Carbs, which it determines as total carbohydrates minus fiber, measured in grams."
3 Ways to Use Dr. Atkins' Diet as a Vegetarian or Vegan - wikiHow,Climb the carb ladder.,"Climb the carb ladder. The plan for Phase 2, for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike, is to add food groups and higher carb foods individually to gauge their impact and determine your ideal balance. Phase 2 typically starts at 25 g. of Net Carbs daily, which is increased in 5 g. increments (weekly, biweekly, or monthly, depending on your goals/preferences). Vegetarians, however, can start at 30 g. and build up from there.[2] X Research source Atkins also recommends that vegetarians introduce seeds before berries, to facilitate protein and fat intake."
3 Ways to Use Dr. Atkins' Diet as a Vegetarian or Vegan - wikiHow,Pack in the protein.,"Pack in the protein. Without meat available as an easy low carb protein source, vegetarians on Atkins need to rely on options like eggs, cheese, and soy. All through the Atkins diet, you'll see that protein is essential. Find sources that are appropriate to your dietary restrictions and focus on a variety of ways to get these into your diet to hit your protein goal. Atkins calls eggs one of natures most nutritious creations,[3] X Research source so if you are a vegetarian who includes them, they will be a backbone of your diet plan. Eggs can be a daily breakfast staple, and in any form  boiled, fried, deviled, chopped, etc.  can be included in meals and snacks throughout the day. No one can live on eggs alone, however, and especially if you are a vegetarian that eschews them, move your focus onto things such as soy, cheese, and other sources of dairy, like cottage cheese and yogurt. From edamame to tofu to meat substitute products, soybeans are an incredibly versatile source of protein for vegetarians. Soybeans provide the most complete vegetable protein and supply only about 3-6 Net Carbs per serving as edamame, tofu, or tempeh. [4] X Research source [5] X Research source Consider also gluten-based meat substitutes, such as seitan, or Quorn, a meat substitute made from fungi."
3 Ways to Use Dr. Atkins' Diet as a Vegetarian or Vegan - wikiHow,Focus on Foundation Vegetables.,"Focus on Foundation Vegetables. In Atkins terminology, Foundation Vegetables are key low-carb veggies that are meant to add up to 12-15 Net Carbs daily.[6] X Research source Salad greens are heavily represented as Foundation Vegetables because of their low Net Carb counts. You will consume less than one Net Carb gram per half-cup of alfalfa sprouts, endive, arugula, radishes, spinach, lettuce, and turnip greens, among others. Other low Net Carb veggies include mushrooms, cucumbers, broccoli, asparagus, and green beans. Starchy vegetables like potatoes dont make the cut, nor do corn or carrots because of their sugar content. So, if you arent already a salad-lover as a vegetarian, you may want to become one before trying Atkins, though there should be enough vegetable variety to keep you happy."

Atkins 40 is a newer version of the diet plan that is meant to provide a bit more flexibility, as well as a bit more leeway on carbs.[7] X Research source With it, you start with 40 g. Net Carbs daily, (10 per meal times three, 5 per shack times two), and add 10 g. weekly after getting within 10 pounds of your weight goal. Foundation Vegetables should make up 15 g. of your daily Net Carbs (around 6-8 servings), with other carb foods making up the remaining 25 g. This, then, provides you a little more room for including nuts, beans, legumes, and whole grains into your meals from the start, which might make life much easier for a vegetarian."
3 Ways to Use Dr. Atkins' Diet as a Vegetarian or Vegan - wikiHow,Make further adjustments to Atkins 20 Phase 2.,"Make further adjustments to Atkins 20 Phase 2. As with vegetarians, it is recommended that vegans using Atkins 20 (the traditional plan) start with Phase 2. This balancing phase permits more carbs, but also requires some additional adjustments for vegans.[8] X Research source Vegans are recommended to start with 50 g. Net Carbs per day, as opposed to the 25 g. for standard Phase 2 or 30 g. for vegetarians who consume eggs and dairy. Vegans will still follow the guide of adding 5 g. per day in increments made weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly (based on preference), up to 80 g. Net Carbs. Vegans are also advised to make allowances for seeds, nuts, and legumes from the start, instead of introducing them over time. Basically, even Atkins itself is admitting that vegans, due to the limited protein sources available to them to begin with, cannot consume enough calories per day on Atkins without making some changes. But with adaptation, it is possible to succeed."
3 Ways to Use Dr. Atkins' Diet as a Vegetarian or Vegan - wikiHow,Be precise with the rest of the plan.,"Be precise with the rest of the plan. Since vegans have to make some alterations to important elements of the Atkins 20 plan, it becomes even more imperative for them to adhere closely to the remaining parts of it.[9] X Research source Eat frequently, with no more than 3-4 hours between meals or snacks. Feeling hungry all the time is more likely to trigger carb cravings. Make sure you are spreading out your Net Carbs during these frequent meals. Using 40 of your 50 allotted Net Carbs at one meal  for instance, pairing  cup of chickpeas (22 Net Carbs) with a cup of soy milk (17 Net Carbs) will leave vegans in particular with very few dining options for the rest of the day.[10] X Research source [11] X Research source Also, consuming too many carbs at one time can cause a spike in insulin, which helps convert carbohydrates into fat, and which the Atkins diet is constructed to avoid.[12] X Research source Drink eight glasses of water daily, as is recommended for all Atkins dieters. Hydration is important for everyone, and water can be surprisingly effective at curbing hunger temporarily. Choose lower-carb whole grains as needed, such as long-grain brown rice and whole-grain pasta (of which Atkins sells branded versions if youre interested). Vegans wont have a problem with getting their daily vegetables in, but stick primarily to the Foundation Vegetables with lower Net Carbs.[13] X Research source"

Net Carbs, 5.4 g. protein), and tempeh (3.3 g. Net Carbs, 15.4 g. protein), or in foods ranging from (miso) soup to (soy) nuts, soybeans need to play a central role in the diet of any vegan on Atkins.[14] X Research source This wikiHow article offers some ideas on vegan cooking with soy and other proteins and is a gateway to various wikiHow vegan recipes.

Atkins, not surprisingly, states Imagine how much better this group would have done if they followed Atkins protocols for carb consumption?,[19] X Research source but lets presume that you intend to stick to the diet as described in the study.

Move things like tables and chairs to eliminate reflective surfaces that may be bouncing sound back into your input."
3 Ways to Get Rid of Feedback From Your Amp - wikiHow,Turn your amp so that the front is pointed towards the wall.,"Turn your amp so that the front is pointed towards the wall. Pointing your amp towards the wall may stifle the sound but it will also prevent any feedback. Because sound-waves wont be directly playing into your input, its unlikely that you will get feedback. Pick up or roll your amplifier towards a wall and leave around 2-3 inches from the amp and the wall. Putting your amp on a carpet instead of a hardwood floor will reduce reverberations throughout the house."
3 Ways to Get Rid of Feedback From Your Amp - wikiHow,Move further away from the amp.,"Move further away from the amp.

This will also help you if you are on stage and are experiencing a lot of feedback. Buying a longer cord will allow you the freedom to move around while you are playing."
3 Ways to Get Rid of Feedback From Your Amp - wikiHow,Lower the effect on distortion pedals.,"Lower the effect on distortion pedals. If you have a distortion pedal plugged into the amp, that could be the source of the feedback you're hearing. Distortion or effect pedals can create feedback when the effects are turned too high. Try turning down both the level and the gain knobs. Certain pedals are capable of creating more feedback. Overdrive effects for heavy metal or hardcore music have a greater chance of creating unintended feedback than a blues or jazz pedal because of the intended sound. Try unplugging your guitar from the pedal and plug your guitar directly into the amp. If there is no feedback, then the pedal is your culprit."
3 Ways to Get Rid of Feedback From Your Amp - wikiHow,Use an equalizer to turn down the frequency on the channel that has the feedback.,"Use an equalizer to turn down the frequency on the channel that has the feedback. If you have an equalizer, you can turn down the frequency range for the guitar that you have plugged in. This will effectively eliminate all feedback because it wont register through the equalizer.[4] X Research source External or add-on equalizers may be more effective at eliminating your feedback. Depending on the quality of your amplifier, an external component may be better quality than the one that comes with your amp. Electric guitar frequency range is 80 Hz to about 1200 Hz.[5] X Research source You may have to test different frequencies for your specific guitar. Lower the frequency by turning the knob counter-clockwise within your range."

A noise suppressor is made to eliminate feedback, humming, and any other unwanted noise that is coming from your amp. This pedal does not affect the guitar's natural tone, but does cost money. If you absolutely can not get rid of your feedback, or want a cleaner sound on your guitar, this is an option. Turn the noise reduction knob clockwise to reduce the ambient sound and feedback from the guitar. Play with the threshold knob until you do not hear static from your amp. You have to find the level for your specific guitar and amp."

For a simple Victorian look, keep a straight middle part and use a curling iron to create ringlets. Pull most of them back into a bun while letting a few trail down around your face.[7] X Research source If you dont want to curl your hair, try putting it in a bun, leaving 2 thick chunks on the side free. Pull these loosely back towards the bun and pin them to create interesting loops. Victorian women also liked to experiment with braids and styles like crimping, so feel free to get creative.

If you want to get more creative, choose a lighter blue color or an old-fashioned pattern, like flowers or birds, which a pioneer woman might have worn on a special occasion. If you dont have a button-down shirt, a plain long-sleeve or three-quarter-length shirt will work as well.

So when it comes to jabbing, it's absolutely imperative that you keep your elbows in when you punch. Your opponent can easily see from side to side -- it's the up and down that's harder to spot. If your elbows are flailing at your sides, you'll be asking for it. Only thing on the up-down plane. There is no left and right when it comes to your elbows.

If you just ""push"" out your punch, there won't be any power behind it. But at the same time, you are, by no means, launching your weight forward. The bag might show that you have force, but any real-life opponent will be able to quickly get an attack in when you're all off balance and tense. Weight does not equal power.

For example, you might say ""Managed 20-person sales force for 10 years."" Use active verbs to describe your responsibilities and accomplishments.

Focus on hard skills that can be objectively evaluated, such as computer or technical skills or languages.[12] X Research source It can be tempting to fudge a little in your skills section and exaggerate your skill level to sound more impressive. However, this can get you in trouble. For example, if you only know a handful of words and phrases in Spanish, don't put on your resume that you're conversational or even fluent. If the hiring manager starts talking to you in Spanish, you've eliminated your chances of getting hired.

How to Make a Resume (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Edit your resume to eliminate excess words and create space.,"Edit your resume to eliminate excess words and create space. Active, punchy text is essential in a resume, since the document will likely only be glanced at for a few seconds. Remove pronouns, articles, adjectives, and adverbs. The final statement should communicate only the action and the result of that action.[16] X Research source For example, suppose you worked as a barista at a caf. You might include a bullet point that you maintained high sanitation standards. However, you want to make that as quantifiable as possible. You might say ""Implemented new sanitation program; increased caf health and sanitation score by 11%.""

If you have difficulty with contractions and possessives, read what you've written as though you spelled the full words out rather than using an apostrophe and see if it makes sense. For example, you could easily find the error in the sentence ""Trained sales staff and reported they're progress"" if you read it as ""Trained sales staff and reported they are progress."" Make sure your formatting and punctuation are consistent. For example, if you use bullet points in one section, you should use them in all sections.

How to Know if Something Is Sterling Silver: 12 Proven Tests,Real sterling silver from the UK will have a stamped image on it.,"Real sterling silver from the UK will have a stamped image on it. Theres an odd tradition in the United Kingdom of stamping sterling silver based on where and when it was made. This was particularly popular before 1970 (some modern jewelers have since adopted the US system). If you spot a stamped sigil, look online to see where its from. If the stamp lines up with the provenance (which is the story of where its from), its likely real.[4] X Research source For example, an uncrowned leopards head means the piece was made in London from 1821-today. A castle means that it was made in Edinburgh. Additional stamps may indicate authorship or date. An AB stamp could stand for A. Beardshaw & Co., for example. Other countries may have their own unique stamp. France currently marks its sterling silver items with the head of Minerva (92.5% and below) or a vase (99.9% pure silver), for example."
How to Know if Something Is Sterling Silver: 12 Proven Tests,The Sound Test,"The Sound Test When sterling silver is gently tapped with a piece of metal, it will produce a high-pitched bell-like tone that lasts for 1 to 2 seconds. To conduct this test, carefully tap the sterling silver item with a metal coin. If the item is truly sterling silver, it will generate a high-pitch ring. If you do not hear a ring, the item is unlikely to be sterling silver.[5] X Research source It can help to do this by comparing the sound to a piece of authentic sterling silver. If you have a US quarter made before 1965, thatll work! Those quarters are 90% silver (900)."

If a little bit of black residue comes off, its sterling silver.[8] X Research source If you see black marks, the item is either silver or sterling silver. If nothing comes off, the item is almost positively not sterling silver."
How to Know if Something Is Sterling Silver: 12 Proven Tests,The Magnet Test,"The Magnet Test Like gold and platinum, silver is a non-ferrous metal, which is a fancy way of saying its not magnetic. Run a strong magnet over your item. If the item is not attracted to the magnet, it is likely that youve got real sterling silver.[9] X Research source If the item sticks to the magnet, it does not contain sterling silver. More than likely, the item is made from highly polished stainless steel intended to look like pure silver."
How to Know if Something Is Sterling Silver: 12 Proven Tests,The Ice Test,"The Ice Test Silver has the highest thermal conductivity rate of any known metal, which means it conducts heat. Set two ice cubes out. Put the silver item on one of them. If the ice cube under the silver melts faster than the other ice cube, youve got real silver.[10] X Research source Alternatively, you can put the silver underneath the ice cube. You should see a puddle forming almost immediately if its real silver."

However, if your parent only owns a vehicle and some personal property (such as furniture, clothing, and household goods), they likely fall below the threshold. The specific threshold for formal probate varies among states. However, it's typically over $50,000.[5] X Research source In some states, such as California, it's as high as $100,000.[6] X Research source"

If your parent has a will, they likely named the person they wanted to be their personal representative.[7] X Research source If the personal representative your parent named in their will is not available, see if your parent named an alternate. If they didn't, you'll have to determine who is willing to serve in this capacity. Choose someone who is mentally and emotionally prepared to take on this role. You can also hire a lawyer to serve as your parent's personal representative. However, this is usually a more expensive option than using someone who is a close friend or member of the family.

If you are not the next of kin, or if you have other siblings, you'll need letters or affidavits from them stating that they have no interest in the property. For example, if you have a sister and your parent has a brother who has 2 kids, you would typically list your uncle, 2 cousins, yourself, and your sister on your list of heirs. You and your sister would be considered your parent's next of kin, assuming your parent was divorced or your other parent was not living.

Typically, if you're transferring property using an affidavit, there won't be any court proceedings. You'll also need to provide details about the property that you want to be transferred to you.[14] X Research source If there are other heirs, they'll likely need to sign your affidavits as well. For example, if you have a sibling, they would need to sign the affidavit, even if you're the only one submitting it.

In addition to your parent's death certificate, the institution holding the property needs proof that your parent owned the property you're trying to take ownership of. Generally, the institution will tell you exactly what documents or information you'll need.[15] X Research source For example, if your parent had a bank account, you'll typically need to know the bank account number and the name on the account. You might also need your parent's debit card, if they had one. A recent bank statement would have the information that you need. Some property has a specific ownership document. For example, if your parent owned a car, you would use the title in their name to prove their ownership. With their death certificate and an affidavit, you could then get the title transferred to your name."
How to Transfer Property After the Death of a Parent - wikiHow,Submit your affidavits to the relevant authorities.,"Submit your affidavits to the relevant authorities.

3 Ways to Mix Colors - wikiHow,Make shades of colors by adding black to them.,"Make shades of colors by adding black to them. Darker versions of a colors original hue are called shades. These are created by adding black paint to a pigment. How dark the shade is depends on how much black paint you add to the original hue; the more black paint you add, the darker the shade.[8] X Research source Some artists prefer to add the color's complement, which is its opposite color on an accurate CMY/RGB color wheel. For example, green can be used to darken magenta, and magenta to darken green, because they are across from each other on the color wheel. Add black paint, or a complement, a little at a time so you don't overdo it. If your shade comes out too dark, you can lighten it by adding a little of the original paint color to the mix."
3 Ways to Mix Colors - wikiHow,"Mix a color with both black and white paint to produce dull, muted tones.","Mix a color with both black and white paint to produce dull, muted tones. Tones are produced by adding both black and white to a color and will appear less intense and less saturated than the original hue. By varying the relative amounts of black and white that you add to your mix, you can obtain whatever lightness and saturation you are looking for.[9] X Research source For example, add both white and black to yellow to make light olive green. The black will darken yellow, turning it into olive green, and the white will lighten that olive green. Different light olive greens can be mixed by controlling how much of each is added. For an unsaturated color like brown (dark orange), you can adjust the hue the same way as you would for bright orange: by adding small amounts of nearby colors on the color wheel, such as magenta, yellow, red, or orange. These will brighten your brown as well as change the hue."

You may want to reconsider the relationship if they cant accept what you need."

Its important to let your partner know about any physical boundaries you have from the start, or at least when the subject is brought up. Sometimes this may occur to you in the heat of the moment while other boundaries may be clear to you upfront. Just communicate what you need clearly and politely.

Trying saying, I enjoy being in a relationship with you, but Im not willing to allow you to tell me what I can and cannot do. I respect you enough not to treat you that way, and I expect you to do the same.

3 Ways to Set Boundaries with People - wikiHow,Communicate any consequences.,"Communicate any consequences. It can seem harsh, but an important part of boundary-setting is setting consequences for violations. Your boundaries hold absolutely no weight if you speak them but never enforce any consequences when they are crossed.[4] X Research source As you discuss your boundaries with your partner, provide some reasonable repercussions for when they break them. This might sound like ""If you invade my privacy, I will be less likely to share things with you in the future"" or ""If you are disrespectful to me, I will cease communication with you."" Some consequences might be presented as final outcomes while others are communicated through warnings. Just be sure to actually follow through and enforce your consequences.

3 Ways to Set Boundaries with People - wikiHow,Make it clear what your responsibilities are.,"Make it clear what your responsibilities are. Families often have that one person who holds everyone together. If you want to be that person, great. If not, youll need to let everyone know. Otherwise, youll be the person who is expected to set up get-togethers, resolve conflicts, keep in touch with everyone, and so on. For example, if you have a relative who always expects you to have Thanksgiving dinner at your home, you could say, I really like that you feel comfortable in my home and like to celebrate Thanksgiving here. Unfortunately, its a lot of work and I dont think Ill be able to do it this year. However, Id love to help you if you want to host it at your place.

Your mom may talk about how much her sisters kids do for her, and people ask her why you dont do the same. Let them know you do what you can, and you wont bend because of a guilt trip. When a relative is thickly laying on the guilt, try saying, I understand where you are coming from. However, I dont appreciate you trying to guilt me into doing something I dont want to do. I am only willing to help as much as I feel comfortable with. If you continue, I wont help at all. While you are being stern, you are also staying respectful.

3 Ways to Set Boundaries with People - wikiHow,Explain what behaviors you won't accept.,"Explain what behaviors you won't accept. Going from raising a child to only seeing them every so often is difficult for some parents. They may still want to have dinner with you every night like they did when you were growing up, but you may only want to share a meal once a week. Let them know what will work for you, and what wont. For instance, you could tell them you would like them to call before they stop by. You could also tell them that some parts of your life, such as your personal life, are off-limits. Also let them know that you wont tolerate any negative comments about your choices in life, who you are dating, your appearance, or anything else. Setting these clear boundaries may cause some backlash, but it will likely be worth it in the end.[8] X Research source"
3 Ways to Set Boundaries with People - wikiHow,Offer alternatives to what they want.,"Offer alternatives to what they want. You may have a friend who wants to come over and stay all day. Or you may have a buddy who would like to cry to you for hours each day about their ex-lover. Being a good friend doesnt mean doing everything they want you to do. You have every right to decide what you feel comfortable with. You dont have to cut them off completely, however, you can offer alternatives. For instance, you can say, You can come over, but only for a few hours because I have things I need to do. Or, you can tell your friend, We can talk about your ex for 15 minutes. After that, I would like to talk to you about whats going on in my life. Youre still there for them, but youre also not subjecting yourself to only what they want."
3 Ways to Set Boundaries with People - wikiHow,"Tell your friend youll help, but you expect help, too.","Tell your friend youll help, but you expect help, too. You may be that friend who consistently makes themselves available to help out. But you may also find that you are always asked for help but never receive any in return. Let your friends know that you expect the same amount of help that you give. For example, if your friend always bums a ride, you could say, I dont mind taking you places, but Ill need some gas money if this is going to continue. Or, if you have a pal who always asks you to babysit their kids but never wants to watch yours, say, Sure, Ill babysit, if you watch my kids next weekend. Youre still helping, but youre creating a clear boundary that shows you would like some help, too."
3 Ways to Set Boundaries with People - wikiHow,Give a warning.,"Give a warning. Let them know youll be there for them, with conditions. Some friends want to use up all youve got, but never offer anything in return. They may continually break promises, constantly borrow things from you but refuse to return the favor, and so on. These are friends you dont need, and youll need to let them know now. Offer a warning about boundary violations to let your friend know when they occur. You might say, ""Hey, you stood me up last night and that wasn't cool. I'll stop making plans with you if this happens again."""

How to Tell if Someone Has Bipolar Disorder,Look for unusually intense mood episodes.,"Look for unusually intense mood episodes. A mood episode represents a significant, even drastic, change from a persons typical mood. In popular language, these may be called mood swings.[2] X Research source People who suffer from bipolar disorder may switch rapidly between mood episodes, or their moods may persist for weeks or months.[3] X Expert Source Catherine Boswell, PhDLicensed Psychologist Expert Interview. 18 December 2020. There are two basic types of mood episode: extremely elevated, or manic episodes, and extremely depressed, or depressive episodes.

How to Tell if Someone Has Bipolar Disorder,Educate yourself about the multiple types of bipolar disorder.,"Educate yourself about the multiple types of bipolar disorder. There are four basic types of bipolar disorder that are regularly diagnosed: Bipolar I, Bipolar II, Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, and Cyclothymia. The type of bipolar disorder a person is diagnosed with is determined by its severity and duration, as well as how quickly the mood episodes cycle. A trained mental health professional must diagnose bipolar disorder; you cannot do it yourself and should not attempt to do so.[6] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Bipolar I Disorder involves manic or mixed episodes that last for at least seven days. The person may also have severe manic episodes that put them in enough danger to require immediate medical attention. Depressive episodes also occur, usually lasting at least two weeks.[7] X Research source Bipolar II Disorder involves episodes of 'hypomania', which rarely escalates to full-blown mania, and more lasting episodes of depression. Hypomania is a milder manic state, in which the person feels very on, is extremely active, and appears to require little to no sleep; other symptoms of mania such as racing thoughts, rapid speech, and flights of ideas might also be present, but unlike those in manic states, people experiencing hypomania do not generally lose touch with reality or the ability to function. Untreated, this type of manic state may develop into severe mania.[8] X Trustworthy Source Mind U.K.-based mental health charity focused on providing advice and resources to anyone facing mental health problems. Go to source The depressive episodes in Bipolar II are generally assumed to be more severe and lasting than the depressive episodes in Bipolar I. It is important to note that a wide range of symptoms might be associated with both types I and II, and the experiences of every individual sufferer are different, so while conventional wisdom dictates as much, this is often, but not always the case. Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (BP-NOS) is a diagnosis made when symptoms of bipolar disorder are present but dont meet the rigid diagnostic criteria of the DSM-5 (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). These symptoms are still not typical for the persons normal or baseline range. Cyclothymic disorder or cyclothymia is a mild form of bipolar disorder. Periods of hypomania alternate with shorter, milder episodes of depression. This must persist for at least two years to meet diagnostic criteria.[9] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source A person with bipolar disorder may also experience rapid cycling, in which they experience four or more mood episodes within a 12-month period.

How to Tell if Someone Has Bipolar Disorder,Know how to recognize a manic episode.,"Know how to recognize a manic episode. How a manic episode manifests may vary from person to person. However, it will represent a dramatically more elevated or revved up mood from the persons normal or baseline emotional state. Some symptoms of mania include:[11] X Trustworthy Source National Alliance on Mental Illness Grassroots mental health-focused organization providing resources, support, and education for those affected by mental illness Go to source Feelings of extreme joy, happiness, or excitement. A person having a manic episode may feel so buzzed or happy that even bad news cannot damage their mood. This feeling of extreme happiness persists even without apparent causes. Overconfidence, feelings of invulnerability, delusions of grandeur. A person having a manic episode may have an overinflated ego or higher sense of self-esteem than is typical for them. Thy may believe they can accomplish more than is feasible, as though absolutely nothing can get in their way. They may imagine that they have special connections to figures of importance or supernatural phenomena. Increased, sudden irritability and anger. A person having a manic episode may snap at others, even without provocation. They are likely to be more touchy or easily angered than is usual in their typical mood. Hyperactivity. The person may take on multiple projects at once, or schedule more things to do in a day than reasonably can be accomplished. They may choose to do activities, even seemingly purposeless ones, instead of sleeping or eating. Increased talkativeness, scattered speech, racing thoughts. The person having a manic episode will often have difficulty collecting their thoughts, even though they are extremely talkative. They may jump very quickly from one thought or activity to another. Feeling jittery or agitated. The person may feel agitated or restless. They may be easily distracted. Sudden increase in risky behavior. The person may do things that are unusual for their normal baseline and pose a risk, such as having unsafe sex, going on shopping sprees, or gambling. Risky physical activities such as speeding or undertaking extreme sports or athletic feats -- especially ones the person is not adequately prepared for -- may also occur. Decreased sleeping habits. The person may sleep very little, yet claim to feel rested. They may experience insomnia or simply feel like they dont need to sleep."
How to Tell if Someone Has Bipolar Disorder,Know how to recognize a depressive episode.,"Know how to recognize a depressive episode. If a manic episode makes a person with bipolar disorder feel like theyre on top of the world, a depressive episode is the feeling of being crushed at the bottom of it. The symptoms may vary between people, but there are some common symptoms to look out for:[12] X Research source Intense feelings of sadness or despair. Like the feelings of happiness or excitement in the manic episodes, these feelings may not appear to have a cause. The person may feel hopeless or worthless, even if you make attempts to cheer them up. Anhedonia. This is a fancy way of saying that the person no longer shows interest or enjoyment in things thy used to enjoy doing. Sex drive may also be lower. Fatigue. Its common for people suffering from major depression to feel tired all the time. They may also complain of feeling sore or achy. Disrupted sleep pattern. With depression, a persons normal sleep habits are disrupted in some way. Some people sleep too much while others may sleep too little. Either way, their sleep habits are markedly different from what is normal for them. Appetite changes. People with depression may experience weight loss or weight gain. They may overeat or not eat enough. This varies depending on the person and represents a change from what is normal for them. Trouble concentrating. Depression can make it difficult to focus or make even small decisions. A person may feel nearly paralyzed when theyre experiencing a depressive episode. Suicidal thoughts or actions. Dont assume that any expressions of suicidal thoughts or intentions are just for attention. Suicide is a very real risk for people with bipolar disorder. Call 911 or emergency services immediately if your loved one expresses suicidal thoughts or intents."

How to Tell if Someone Has Bipolar Disorder,Reject some common myths about mental illness.,"Reject some common myths about mental illness. Mental illness is commonly stigmatized as something wrong with the person. It may be viewed as something they could just snap out of if they tried hard enough or thought more positively. The fact is, these ideas are simply not true. Bipolar disorder is the result of complex interacting factors including genetics, brain structure, chemical imbalances in the body, and sociocultural pressures.[16] X Trustworthy Source National Institute of Mental Health Informational website from U.S. government focused on the understanding and treatment of mental illness. Go to source A person with bipolar disorder cant just stop having the disorder. However, bipolar disorder is also treatable. Consider how you would speak to someone who had a different sort of illness, such as cancer. Would you ask that person, Have you ever tried just not having cancer? Telling someone with bipolar disorder to just try harder is equally incorrect. Medication and therapy can help manage the symptoms of bipolar disorder, but the disorder can last a lifetime.[17] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Theres a common misconception that bipolar is rare. In fact, about 6 million American adults suffer from some type of bipolar disorder.[18] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Even famous individuals such as Stephen Fry, Carrie Fisher, and Jean-Claude Van Damme have been open about being diagnosed with bipolar disorder.[19] X Research source Another common myth is that manic or depressive mood episodes are normal or even a good thing. While its true that everyone has their good days and bad days, bipolar disorder causes shifts in mood that are far more extreme and damaging than the typical mood swings or off days. They cause significant dysfunction in the persons daily life. A common mistake is to confuse schizophrenia with bipolar disorder. They are not at all the same illness, although they have a few symptoms (such as depression) in common. Bipolar disorder is characterized principally by the shift between intense mood episodes. Schizophrenia generally causes symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech, which do not often appear in bipolar disorder. It is possible for someone with schizoaffective disorder, to have the symptoms of both though.[20] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Many people believe that people with bipolar disorder or depression are dangerous to others. The news media is particularly bad about promoting this idea. In reality, research shows that people with bipolar disorder dont commit any more violent acts than people without the disorder. People with bipolar disorder may be more likely to consider or attempt suicide, however.[21] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source"
How to Tell if Someone Has Bipolar Disorder,Avoid hurtful language.,"Avoid hurtful language. Some people may jokingly say theyre a little bipolar or schizo when describing themselves, even if they have not been diagnosed with a mental illness. In addition to being inaccurate, this type of language trivializes the experience of people who have bipolar disorder. Be respectful when discussing mental illness.[22] X Research source Its important to remember that people are more than the sum of their illness. Dont use totalizing phrases such as I think youre bipolar. Instead, say something like, I think you may have bipolar disorder. Referring to someone as their illness reduces them to one element about them. This promotes the stigma that all too often still surrounds mental illness, even if you dont mean it that way.[23] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Trying to comfort the other person by saying Im a little bipolar too or I know how you feel can do more damage than good.

How to Tell if Someone Has Bipolar Disorder,Talk about your concerns with your loved one.,"Talk about your concerns with your loved one. You might be worried about talking to your loved one for fear of upsetting them. Its actually very helpful and important for you to talk with your loved one about your concerns. Not talking about mental illness promotes the unfair stigma around it and may encourage people with a disorder to wrongly believe that they are bad or worthless or should feel ashamed of their illness. When approaching your loved one, be open and honest, and show compassion. Supporting someone who suffers from bipolar disorder can help them recover and manage their illness.[24] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Reassure the person that they arent alone. Bipolar disorder can make a person feel very isolated. Tell your loved one that you are here for them and want to support them in any way you can. Acknowledge that your loved ones illness is real. Trying to minimize your loved ones symptoms wont make them feel better. Instead of trying to tell the person that the illness is no big deal, acknowledge that the condition is serious but treatable. For example: I know that you have a real illness and that it causes you to feel and do things that arent like you. We can find help together. Convey your love and acceptance to the person. Particularly while in a depressive episode, the person may believe that they are worthless or ruined. Counter these negative beliefs by expressing your love and acceptance of the person. For example: I love you, and you are important to me. I care about you, and thats why I want to help you."
How to Tell if Someone Has Bipolar Disorder,Use I statements to convey your feelings.,"Use I statements to convey your feelings. When talking with another person, its crucial that you not seem as though youre attacking or judging your loved one. People with mental illness may feel as though the world is against them. Its important to show that youre on your loved ones side and that youre there to support them and help them recover.[25] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, say things such as I care about you and am worried about some things Ive seen. There are some statements that come across as defensive. You should avoid these. For example, avoid saying things like Im just trying to help or You just need to listen to me."
How to Tell if Someone Has Bipolar Disorder,Avoid threats and blame.,"Avoid threats and blame. You may be concerned about your loved ones health, and feel willing to make sure they get help by any means necessary. However, you should never use exaggerations, threats, guilt trips, or accusations to convince the other person to seek help. These will only encourage the other person to believe that you see something wrong with them and that youre not there to help or support them.[26] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Avoid statements such as Youre worrying me or Your behavior is odd. These sound accusative and may shut the other person down. Statements that attempt to play on the other persons sense of guilt are also not helpful. For example, dont try to use your relationship as leverage to get the other person to seek help by saying something like, If you really loved me you would get help or Think about what youre doing to our family. People with bipolar disorder often struggle with feelings of shame and worthlessness, and statements like these will only make that worse. Avoid threats. You cannot force the other person to do what you want. Saying things like If you dont get help Im leaving you or I wont pay for your car anymore if you dont get help will only stress the other person out, and the stress may trigger a severe mood episode."
How to Tell if Someone Has Bipolar Disorder,Frame the discussion as a concern about health.,"Frame the discussion as a concern about health. Some people may be reluctant to acknowledge that they have an issue. When someone with bipolar is experiencing a manic episode, they are often feeling so high that its hard to admit that theres any problem. When a person is experiencing a depressive episode, they may feel like they have a problem but not be able to see any hope for treatment. You can frame your concerns as medical concerns, such as the high risk of self-harm and suicide that bipolar disorder can cause, which may help.[27] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, you can reiterate the idea that bipolar disorder is an illness just like diabetes or cancer. Just as you would encourage the other person to seek treatment for cancer, you want them to seek treatment for this disorder. If the other person is still reluctant to acknowledge theres an issue, you can consider suggesting they visit a doctor for a symptom that youve noticed, rather than for a disorder. For example, you may find that suggesting the other person see a doctor for insomnia or fatigue may be helpful in getting them to seek help."
How to Tell if Someone Has Bipolar Disorder,Encourage the other person to share their feelings and experiences with you.,"Encourage the other person to share their feelings and experiences with you. Its easy for a conversation to express your concern to turn into you preaching at your loved one. To avoid this, invite your loved one to tell you about what they are thinking and feeling in their own words to allow for a genuine conversation about their illness.[28] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Remember: while you may be affected by this persons disorder, it isnt about you. For example, once youve shared your concerns with the person, say something like, Would you like to share what youre thinking right now? or Now that youve heard what I wanted to say, what do you think? Dont assume you know how the other person feels. It can be easy to say something like I know how you feel as reassurance, but in reality, this can sound dismissive. Instead, say something that acknowledges the other persons feelings without claiming them as your own: I can see why that would make you feel sad. If your loved one is resistant to the idea of acknowledging that they have a problem, dont argue about it. You can encourage your loved one to seek treatment, but you cant make it happen."
How to Tell if Someone Has Bipolar Disorder,Dont dismiss your loved ones thoughts and feelings as not real or not worth considering.,"Dont dismiss your loved ones thoughts and feelings as not real or not worth considering. Even if a feeling of worthlessness is caused by a depressive episode, it feels very real to the person experiencing it. Outright dismissing a persons feelings will encourage them not to tell you about them in the future. Instead, validate the persons feelings and challenge negative ideas at the same time. Everyone who suffers from bipolar disorder has a different experience and recovery and management can be helped by avoiding negative influences.[29] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, if your loved one expresses the idea that nobody loves them and theyre a bad person, you could say something like this: I know you feel that way, and Im so sorry that youre experiencing those feelings.

If they feel supported, they may be better able to manage their mental illness.[37] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source For example, you could say something like, It seems like youve been feeling very stressed lately. Would it be helpful if I babysat your kids and gave you an evening of me time? If the person has been experiencing major depression, offer a pleasant distraction. Dont treat the person as fragile and unapproachable just because they have an illness. If you notice that your loved one has been struggling with depressive symptoms (mentioned elsewhere in this article), dont make a big deal of it.

The surgeon will look for openings in the lungs that caused the leak and seal them closed. In some cases, a portion of diseased lung tissue will need to be removed. Treatment time varies and depends on the severity of a collapsed lung, but be prepared for an extended hospital stay. Chest tubes sometimes need to stay in place for a few days before removal.

How to Protect Your Hearing: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Understand noise-related hearing loss.,"Understand noise-related hearing loss. Frequent or prolonged exposure to loud noises is one of the most common causes of hearing loss, despite the fact that this type of hearing loss is completely preventable. Our brain registers sound thanks to a spiral-shaped organ in the inner ear called the cochlea. The cochlea is covered in thousands of tiny hairs which register sound vibrations and turn them into electrical impulses to be processed by the brain. When your ears are exposed to loud noises, these tiny hairs can become damaged, resulting in hearing loss. Although short, intense noises (like fireworks or a gunshot) are sometimes the cause, the most common cause is regular exposure to excessive noise (listening to music too loudly, working in a noisy environment). It's important to realize that once this type of hearing damage occurs, it cannot be reversed. Therefore it is very important to take measures to protect your hearing before it's too late.[1] X Research source"
How to Protect Your Hearing: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Learn to recognize potentially dangerous noise levels.,"Learn to recognize potentially dangerous noise levels. A large part of protecting your hearing is learning to recognize potentially dangerous noise levels. Then you will have a better idea of what to avoid. Prolonged exposure to noise levels above 85 decibels is considered to be damaging to your hearing. To give you an idea of where 85 decibels lies on the scale: Normal conversation: 60 to 65 dB Motorcycle or lawnmower: 85 to 95 dB Music at a nightclub: 110 dB MP3 player at maximum volume: 112 dB Ambulance siren: 120 dB Taking measures to reduce noise levels by just a few decibels can be hugely beneficial for your ears. This is due to the fact that every 3 dB increase in the noise level effectively doubles the amount of sound energy being released. As a result, the amount of time you can safely spend listening to a certain sound rapidly decreases the louder the sound is. For example, you can safely spend up to eight hours listening to an 85 dB sound, but you should only spend 15 minutes exposed to noise levels above 100 dB. If you can't hold a conversation with someone who is standing two meters away from you without shouting, the noise level is damaging to your ears."
How to Protect Your Hearing: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,See a specialist if you suspect hearing damage.,"See a specialist if you suspect hearing damage. If you are having any trouble with your hearing or are experiencing ear pain, it's a good idea to consult a specialist. Depending on the issue, you may need to see an ear, nose and throat doctor (an Otolaryngologist), or a licensed audiologist. Each of these will perform a series of tests to determine whether your hearing has been damaged. While there is no cure for hearing damage, hearing aids can ease the problem by magnifying sounds as they enter your ear. Of course, they are expensive and may not always work, so it's important to protect your hearing."
How to Protect Your Hearing: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Turn down the music.,"Turn down the music. Listening to loud music through earphones has been identified as one of the major causes of hearing loss in young people. The volume on your MP3 player is too high if it completely drowns out all background noise, or if it feels uncomfortable to listen to. Switch to headphones instead of earphones, as these provide better sound quality at a lower volume. Try to follow the 60/60 rule when listening to music on an MP3 player. This means you should listen to music at no more than 60% of your music player's maximum volume, for no more than 60 minutes at a time. You also need to be careful when listening to music in enclosed spaces, such as in a car. Turning the volume dial down just a couple of notches can make a huge difference to your hearing.[2] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source"
How to Protect Your Hearing: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Protect your hearing at work.,"Protect your hearing at work. Some workplaces can be described as ""hazardous sound environments,"" where workers are exposed to loud noises for prolonged periods of time. This includes work environments such as factories with noisy machinery and construction sites. Nowadays, most workplaces have to follow strict regulations to protect their employees' hearing. Workers are required to wear noise canceling ear muffs or earplugs if the average daily noise level is above 85 decibels. However, people who are self-employed are responsible for their own hearing, so don't forget to wear hearing protection if you're doing activities like mowing the lawn or doing home improvements. If you are concerned about the noise levels in your workplace, speak to an occupational health and safety officer or to someone in the human resources department."
How to Protect Your Hearing: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Be careful at live concerts and shows.,"Be careful at live concerts and shows. Attending concerts or shows where you're exposed to loud, live music can be damaging to your hearing. For example, many people experience a ringing sound in their ears after leaving a concert, which should be taken as a warning sign. To protect your ears while listening to live music, strategically position yourself away from any amplifiers, speakers or stage monitors. The further away you are from the source of the sound, the better. Take ""quiet breaks."" If you're spending the night at a music bar or club, try to go outside for five minutes every hour. Just giving your ears a break from the constant noise exposure will do them some good. Another alternative is to wear earplugs while you listen to live music. This can reduce the sound levels by 15 to 35 decibels, but shouldn't muffle your hearing or affect your enjoyment of the concert. If you are a musician yourself, try to avoid practicing at full performance volume and wear earplugs while playing, if possible."
How to Protect Your Hearing: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Protect your baby or child's hearing.,"Protect your baby or child's hearing. If you are pregnant, it's important to avoid loud noises because a fetus's hearing can be damaged in utero. Similarly, young babies and children have thin skulls and developing ears, and are very sensitive to loud noises. If you are pregnant, avoid loud concerts or workplace noise that exceeds 85 dB (about the level of a motorcycle engine), which has been linked to hearing loss in children. Loud noises during pregnancy has also been linked to a low birth weight and preterm delivery.[3] X Research source Newborns should never be exposed to sudden loud noises. Noise above 80 dB has been linked to hearing loss and infant anxiety. Young children have more sensitive hearing than adults, so if an environment seems loud to you, it is even louder to your child.

How to Protect Your Hearing: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Don't try to clean out your ears.,"Don't try to clean out your ears. Many people attempt to clean out their ears using cotton buds. However, cotton buds simply pack earwax deeper into the ear, potentially damaging the thin, sensitive skin and negatively affecting your hearing. Most people don't need to clean out their ears, as your ears need a certain amount of wax for protection and any excess will naturally be expelled. But if you feel you have excess wax in your ears, you can get rid of it using an earwax removal kit. To use, place a couple of drops of earwax solution into your ears before bedtime, over the course of a couple of nights. The solution will soften the earwax, causing it to flow out naturally.[5] X Research source"
How to Protect Your Hearing: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Lead a healthy lifestyle.,"Lead a healthy lifestyle. Making certain healthy lifestyle choices can help to protect your hearing and ward off hearing loss for years to come. Get plenty of exercise.

It's even better if you can do your exercise somewhere nice and quiet, like the woods or a secluded beach, as this also gives your ears a break from the hustle and bustle of daily life. Quit smoking. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that people who smoke (or are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke) are much more likely to experience age-related hearing loss. Decrease your caffeine and sodium intake. Both caffeine and sodium can have a negative effect on your hearing -- caffeine decreases blood flow to the ears, while sodium increases fluid retention which can lead to swelling in the inner ear. Try switching to decaf coffee and tea and lowering your salt intake.[6] X Research source"

Some evidence indicates Jell-O makes nails grow faster, so stock up on Jell-O if you like it."
How to Repair Nails After a Gel Manicure: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Do not peel off your manicure.,"Do not peel off your manicure. If your manicure is beginning to peel and crack, it can be tempting to pull it off. However, this will cause more damage to your nails. If you want to remove your manicure, either make a new appointment or carefully remove the manicure, yourself. When you peel off your polish, you can peel away the top layer of your nails, as well. This is what causes them to become dry and brittle.[6] X Expert Source Mia RubieNail Artist Expert Interview. 23 April 2020."
How to Repair Nails After a Gel Manicure: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Take a break from gel polish on occasion.,"Take a break from gel polish on occasion. Gel polish can be fun, but when used too much it can seriously affect nail health. Take a break on the gel polish once in awhile so your nails can adequately heal.[7] X Research source Think about getting a keratin manicure between gel manicures."
How to Repair Nails After a Gel Manicure: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Do not cut your cuticles.,"Do not cut your cuticles. Push back your cuticles after a gel manicure instead of cutting them. Your cuticles protect new nails that are growing, so they're vital for recovery after a gel manicure.[8] X Research source You should also treat your cuticles to cuticle creams and gels during the recovery process.[9] X Research source"
How to Repair Nails After a Gel Manicure: 12 Steps (with Pictures),Remove your manicure safely.,"Remove your manicure safely. Proper removal will help keep your nails strong. Before you remove your polish, buff your nails with a nail file to remove the shine on top so you just barely see the natural nail beneath them.

How to Develop a Perfect Speaking Voice: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Speak up,"Speak up. It's important to be heard when you speak, so raise your voice! If you tend to whisper, mumble or speak with your head down, it is much easier for people to talk over you or ignore you.[1] X Research source However, this doesn't mean you should shout - rather, you should vary the loudness of your speech depending on the situation. For example, if you're addressing a large group of people it will be necessary to speak loudly in order to project your voice. But speaking too loudly in normal, everyday conversation is unnecessary and can give the wrong impression."
How to Develop a Perfect Speaking Voice: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Slow down,"Slow down. Speaking too quickly is a bad habit and it can be difficult for people to keep up with you or even understand what you're saying. This makes it easy for them to tune out and stop listening.[2] X Research source Therefore, it's important to slow down your speech by saying your words more slowly and pausing between sentences - this helps to add emphasis to what you're saying and gives you a chance to take a breath! On the other hand, it's a good idea not to speak too slowly. Speaking too slowly can be monotonous for your listeners, so they may become impatient and just tune out. The ideal speaking rate is somewhere between 120 and 160 words per minute. However, if you're giving a speech, it's a good idea to alter the speed at which you speak - speaking slowly can help to emphasize a point, while speaking more quickly can give the impression of passion and enthusiasm.[3] X Research source"
How to Develop a Perfect Speaking Voice: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Enunciate,"Enunciate. Speaking clearly is possibly the most important aspect of developing a good speaking voice. You need to pay close attention to each and every word you say - pronouncing it fully and correctly.[4] X Research source Make sure to open your mouth, loosen your lips and keep your tongue and teeth in the correct position as you speak. This may also help eliminate or disguise a lisp, if you have one. It might feel odd at first, but if you consistently make the effort to pronounce your words correctly, it will soon come naturally to you.[3] X Research source"
How to Develop a Perfect Speaking Voice: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Practice deep breathing,"Practice deep breathing. Deep breathing is essential for a full, rich speaking voice. The majority of people breathe too quickly and shallowly when they speak, which results in a more unnatural, nasal tone.[5] X Research source Your breath should come from your diaphragm, not from your chest. To figure out if you're breathing correctly, place your fist on your abdomen, just below your last rib - you should feel your stomach expand and see your shoulders rise and fall as you breathe. Practice your breathing by inhaling deeply, allowing the air to fill your belly. Breathe in for a count of 5 seconds, then exhale for another 5. Get used to this method of breathing, then try to work it into your everyday speech. Remember that sitting or standing up straight, with your chin up and your shoulders back, will help you to breathe deeper and project your voice more easily. It will also give you an air of confidence as you speak. Try to breathe at the end of every sentence - if you use the deep breathing method, you should have enough air to get through the next sentence without having to pause for breath. This will also give your listeners a chance to absorb what you're saying."
How to Develop a Perfect Speaking Voice: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Vary your pitch,"Vary your pitch. The pitch of your voice can have a real impact on the quality of your speech and the impact it makes on your listeners. In general, speaking in a shaky or unsteady pitch gives the impression of nervousness, while an even voice is more calming and persuasive.[6] X Research source Although you shouldn't try to change the natural pitch of your voice (no Darth Vader impressions, please), you should make an effort to control it. Don't let your nerves get the better of you and aim to achieve a fuller, smoother pitch. You can practice controlling your pitch by humming a tune, or simply by reading a piece of text aloud to yourself. Keep in mind that it's not necessary to maintain a steady pitch at all times - some words should be voiced in a higher pitch in order to add emphasis."
How to Develop a Perfect Speaking Voice: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Do some vocal exercises,"Do some vocal exercises. Practicing vocal exercises can be a good way to develop your natural speaking voice. Practicing while looking in the mirror is the most effective way to achieve this, as are some of these ways: Try to loosen your mouth and relax your vocal cords. You can do this by yawning widely, wiggling your jaw from side to side, humming a tune, and gently massaging your throat muscles with your fingers. Increase your breathing capacity and volume by fully exhaling until all of the air is completely expelled from your lungs, then take a deep breath and hold it for 15 seconds before exhaling again. Work on your pitch by singing the sound ""ah"", first at your normal pitch, then getting progressively lower. You can also do this with each of the letters of the alphabet.[3] X Research source Repeat tongue twisters like: Red leather, yellow leather. She sells seashells by the seashore. Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers."
How to Develop a Perfect Speaking Voice: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Practice reading aloud,"Practice reading aloud. In order to work on pronunciation, pace and volume, it is a good idea to practice reading aloud.[7] X Research source Pick a passage from a book or magazine, or better yet, find a transcript of a famous speech (such as one by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.) and read it aloud to yourself. Remember to stand up straight, breathe deeply and open your mouth fully when you speak. Stand in front of a mirror if it helps. Keep practicing until you are happy with what you hear. Then try to employ the same techniques as part of your everyday speech."
How to Develop a Perfect Speaking Voice: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Record yourself,"Record yourself. Even though most people don't like listening to the sound of their own voices, it's a good idea to record yourself speaking.[8] X Research source This can help you to pick up on any faults that you wouldn't normally pick up on, such as mispronunciations and speed or pitch problems. Nowadays, most phones will have a recording option that you can use to listen to yourself. You could also use a video camera (which could be helpful to check your posture, eye contact and mouth movement)."
How to Develop a Perfect Speaking Voice: 10 Steps (with Pictures),See a voice coach.,"See a voice coach. If you're really worried about improving your speaking voice - for something like a debate, speech or presentation - then it might be a good idea to book an appointment with a voice coach. They can identify your individual speech issues and help you to correct them. A voice coach is also a good idea if you have a native or very colloquial accent that you're trying to minimize or eliminate. Getting rid of an accent is a difficult thing to do, so seeing a professional can really help. If seeing a voice coach seems a little extreme, then consider practising in front of a particularly articulate friend or family member. They may be able to pick up on any issues and give you some helpful pointers. This will also help you to feel more confident about speaking in front of others."
How to Develop a Perfect Speaking Voice: 10 Steps (with Pictures),Smile as you speak.,"Smile as you speak. People will judge you and the content of your speech more favorably if you use an open, friendly, encouraging tone (as opposed to an aggressive, sarcastic or bored one). A good way to make your tone more friendly and warm is to smile while you speak. Not a crazed grin, mind you, but even a slight upturn of the corners of your mouth can make the sound of your voice more appealing - even over the phone. Of course, smiling isn't always appropriate, especially if you're discussing a serious issue. But just remember that inserting emotion into your voice (whatever emotion it may be) can do wonders."

Before you attach your multimeter to the circuit, you need to make sure that the meter is rated for the number of amps traveling through that circuit. Most power sources will have the approximate maximum amps printed on a nameplate, and you can find the maximum amps the multimeter can handle on the back of the device or in the instruction manual. You could also just check how high the dial goesdo not attempt to test more currents than the highest dial setting.[2] X Research source The maximum amps may also be called the maximum current."

The plug-in clamp accessory can extend the range. Just plug the leads into the multimeter and attach the other end to the circuit the way you would attach the multimeter clamps. Place the clamp around the hot or live wire, which is usually black, red, blue, or some other color except white or green. When you use a clamp, it doesn't become part of the circuit, unlike when you are just using a multimeter."
How to Measure Amperage: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Push the black probe into the COM socket on the multimeter.,"Push the black probe into the COM socket on the multimeter. Your multimeter should have a red probe and a black probe, whether you're using a clamp attachment or the probes that came with the meter. One end of the probe will have a prong that plugs into the meter. The black probe, which indicates a negative wire, should always be plugged into the COM socket.[3] X Research source ""COM"" stands for common. If the port isn't marked with COM, you may see a negative symbol, instead. If your leads have prongs, you'll have to hold them in place when you measure the current. If they have clamps, you can attach them to the circuit, freeing up your hands. However, both types of probes will connect to the meter in the same way."
How to Measure Amperage: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,"Place the red probe in the socket labeled ""A.""","Place the red probe in the socket labeled ""A."" You may have several places where you can plug in a red probe, depending on the functions of your meter. The port marked with A measures amperage.[4] X Research source You may see 2 sockets with an A, one labeled as A or 10A and one labeled mA. The one that says A or 10A is designed to measure current up to 10 amps, while the one that says mA measures milli-amps, up to about 300 mA. If you're not sure which one to use, select the higher A or 10A setting to be sure you don't overload the meter. You might also see ports labeled V for voltage or  for ohms. You can disregard these for this test."
How to Measure Amperage: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Select either AC or DC current on the meter.,"Select either AC or DC current on the meter. Unless your meter is designed to only be used on AC or DC circuits, you'll need to select which one you're testing. If you're not sure, check the nameplate on your power source again for that information. It should be listed along with the voltage.[5] X Expert Source Jesse KuhlmanMaster Electrician, Kuhlman Electric Expert Interview. 29 April 2020. AC, or alternating current, is typically used in items like household appliances and electric motors, while DC, or direct current, is commonly used in battery-powered motors and devices.

How to Measure Amperage: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Turn the dial to an amp setting that's higher than what you're measuring.,"Turn the dial to an amp setting that's higher than what you're measuring. Once you've determined the maximum currents you're expecting to test, look for a dial on your meter and turn it a little higher than that number. If you'd like, you can turn the dial all the way to the maximum just to be safe, but if the current you're measuring is too low, you may not get a reading. If that happens, you'll need to turn the dial down and take the reading again.[7] X Research source By setting your meter to handle more amps than you expect to measure, you help protect against blowing the fuses if the current is stronger than you thought. If the current is significantly higher than the amp setting, you could destroy the meter. Some dials are auto-ranging, which means you do not have to manually adjust a dial. If this is the case, you will not see a dial with the amp settings, and the meter will be labeled as auto-ranging, or you may see AUTO on the display.[8] X Trustworthy Source Science Buddies Expert-sourced database of science projects, explanations, and educational material Go to source"
How to Measure Amperage: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Turn off the power to the circuit.,"Turn off the power to the circuit. If your circuit is powered by a battery, unplug the negative lead that's running from that battery. If you have to turn off the power at a breaker, turn off the switch, then disconnect the negative lead. Do not attach the meter with the power turned on to the circuit."
How to Measure Amperage: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Disconnect the red wire coming from the power supply.,"Disconnect the red wire coming from the power supply. In order to test the amount of current flowing through a circuit, you have to attach the multimeter so it completes that circuit. To do this, start by shutting off the power to the circuit, then detach the positive wire, which is almost always red, from the power source.[10] X Research source This process is called breaking the circuit. You may have to cut the wire with wire clippers to break the circuit. However, if you see a cap where the wire from the power source meets the wire going to the device you're testing, you can simply unscrew the cap and unwind the wires from around each other. The wires may also be connected by clips you can disconnect. There's no need to unplug the black wire. In a direct current circuit, the black is negative, while in an alternating current circuit, its the hot wire."
How to Measure Amperage: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Strip the ends of the wire,"Strip the ends of the wire, if necessary. You'll need to wrap a small piece of wire around the multimeter prongs, or have enough wire exposed that the alligator prongs will clamp on securely. If the wire is insulated all the way to the end, clamp your wire clippers about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the end of the wire and squeeze just enough to cut into the rubber insulation. Then, pull the clippers sharply away from you to remove the insulation.[11] X Research source If you accidentally cut into the wire, snip that portion off of the end and try again. You'll need to strip the end of the wire that's coming away from the power source and the wire coming from the device you're testing."
How to Measure Amperage: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Wrap the positive wire around the positive probe on the multimeter.,"Wrap the positive wire around the positive probe on the multimeter. Take the exposed end of the red wire that's coming away from the power source and either wrap it around the prong on the multimeter probe or clamp the alligator clips to the wire, depending on the type of probe you're using. Either way, make sure you attach the wire securely to ensure you get an accurate reading.[12] X Research source Technically, it doesn't really matter if you connect the positive probe to the wire coming from the power source or the device, since the meter just needs to complete the circuit. If it's easier for some reason to attach the wires the other way, that's fine. Attaching the positive wire first can help prevent a short if the negative wire accidentally touches a ground. If youre measuring a circuit without the amp clamp and the reading has a negative sign in front of it, it means you put the leads on backward. Fix it by reversing the leads."
How to Measure Amperage: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Connect the black multimeter probe to the remaining wire and turn on the circuit.,"Connect the black multimeter probe to the remaining wire and turn on the circuit. Next, find the positive wire coming from the electrical component you're trying to test and attach it to the black multimeter probe. If you broke a battery-powered circuit by disconnecting the wires, power will be restored to the circuit once you touch the black probe to the wire. If you turned off the power with a breaker or a switch, turn it back on.[13] X Research source This will be the other end of the wire you cut or disconnected from the power supply. If you're testing in a car, don't start the car, and don't try to turn on any fans, lights, or anything else in the vehicle, as you could overload the meter."
How to Measure Amperage: 12 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Leave the probes in place for about a minute as you read the meter.,"Leave the probes in place for about a minute as you read the meter. Once the meter is in place, you should see a number on the digital display immediately. This is the measurement of your current, or amperage. Although this initial reading may be accurate, for the most precise measurement, leave the probes on the circuit for at least 60 seconds to ensure the current is steady.[14] X Research source If the reading is less than the sensitive setting (for instance, if it reads less than 0.3 A and the sensitive setting measures up to 300 mA), disconnect the meter, move the red probe to mA, and repeat the test. This reading will show you the amperage, or the current, of the circuit you're testing. That's basically how much electricity can flow through that current at one time.[15] X Expert Source Jesse KuhlmanMaster Electrician, Kuhlman Electric Expert Interview. 29 April 2020."

How to Set Up a Buffet (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Choose a room with a lot of potential open space.,"Choose a room with a lot of potential open space. Ten square meters is an ideal amount of room to fit all guests comfortably with room for getting food and mingling. Eight square meters allows for some seating, seven and a half square meters can be comfortable for smaller crowds, and six square meters should be the minimum amount of room that you designate for the buffet. If your location has multiple rooms, consider serving the food and drinks in one room, then having the seating in another room."
How to Set Up a Buffet (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Place the table in the center of the room for the best flow.,"Place the table in the center of the room for the best flow. Clear the room you plan to use for your event, including all clutter, furniture, and decorations. Place the serving table in the middle of the room, then place additional tables to either side for things like plates, silverware, and cups. This will allow the guests to access to the food from both sides of the buffet table and will keep the line moving quickly. An eight-foot table will hold enough food for twenty to thirty people. You will need to put multiple tables together if you are having more people than that over. Make sure that you have a set of serving spoons and tongs for each dish--one for each side of the table."
How to Set Up a Buffet (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Plan a separate table for beverages.,"Plan a separate table for beverages. By situating the beverage table away from the food table, you give your guests a chance to choose their food and put the plates down before pouring a drink.[2] X Research source This minimizes the potential for spills. This is another way to ensure that your guests can maneuver the lines with ease. Consider having separate tables for alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Water should be served at its own table. Depending on how many guests you have, you may want to have multiple pitches. This way, your guests aren't waiting in line."
How to Set Up a Buffet (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Plan traffic flow.,"Plan traffic flow. Designate an entrance and exit to the buffet. You can do this by simply letting people know as they walk up to the table, or by making a sign for each end of the table. Leave plenty of space in front of and on the sides of the table, just in case people decide to pause for a moment. This reduces the chance of crowding.[3] X Research source Keep the types of food as separated as possible. For example, keep dessert far from the first course of the meal. If you will have vegetarian and/or vegan options, it might be a good idea to keep those separate from the non-vegetarian and non-vegan tables. Consider having a smaller table set aside for appetizers. You can place this closer to the wine or champagne table, even."

Consider what was annoying or difficult the last time you went to a buffet. Think about what you would have liked during a buffet and plan your table around that idea. For example:[4] X Research source If you wished you had room to set a plate down momentarily, leave enough extra space on the buffet table for people to do so. If you wished you had the option of tasting the food first, leave toothpicks or little spoons next to the dishes for your guests so that they can try the food. If you ran into issues with trash, consider setting up more trash bins and making them more noticeable so that guests can easily spot them."
How to Set Up a Buffet (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Have a nice presentation.,"Have a nice presentation. Think about what type of plates, cups, utensils, containers, and tablecloth you would like to use for your table. You dont have to use your fine china, but a table is more appetizing if the set up looks nice. Its okay to use plastic silverware, plates, and cups, as long as it is all new and clean. Dont put your food out in greasy, cardboard boxes. Instead, use plastic or metal containers. You will also need a tablecloth. An expensive tablecloth will potentially get ruined by the mess, but look for one that adds cheer to the table.[5] X Research source Decide on a color or a theme when putting out everything on the table. This will bring the look of the table together and make the meal look more appealing. Sometimes, less is more when it comes to decorations. Rather than choosing lots of colors and patterns, stick with just one or two solid colors instead. Many catering places will offer things like plates, cups, and silverware. Rental places for tables and chairs will sometimes have tablecloths that you can borrow as well."
How to Set Up a Buffet (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Place the plates at the start of the line.,"Place the plates at the start of the line. Your guests cant access the food well without first having plates available. If you are planning an event with a lot of people, it is a good idea to set up a buffet with two or three stacks of plates of about ten plates each. You don't, however, want to pile the plates too high, or they will be in danger of tipping over.[6] X Research source Be sure to put condiments near the type of food they belong with. If you have separate tables for things like appetizers and desserts, you will need to add tables for plates near them as well."
How to Set Up a Buffet (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Put silverware at the end of the table.,"Put silverware at the end of the table. Finish the table with the utensils and napkins. A common mistake made by many hosts when planning an event is to place utensils and napkins at the front of the table. It can be cumbersome to try to hold on to knives, forks, spoons, and linens along with a plate while your guests are trying to serve themselves.[7] X Research source Make sure you put out all types of silverware that will be needed. For example, dont forget spoons if there will be soup."
How to Set Up a Buffet (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Make labels.,"Make labels. Prepare labels for each dish ahead of time. This can be on small pieces of paper, sticky notes, or cardboard. Put the labels next to each dish once all of the food is out on the table. This will allow guests to know what the dish is before they put it on their plate, which helps eliminate a lot of uneaten and thrown away food. Make sure the labels are written in bold, large, and clear writing that all guests will be able to read with ease. Typed labels will be more legible than handwritten labels. If a food contains a common allergen, such as peanuts, it would be a good idea to add a warning label as well, such as: Contains Peanuts. If you know that some of your guests are vegetarian or vegan, it would be nice to mention which dishes contain meat or dairy."
How to Set Up a Buffet (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Provide a balanced meal.,"Provide a balanced meal. Plan a meal with a salad, protein, vegetable, starch, carbohydrate, and dessert, unless you are throwing a cocktail party. Buffet meals can feel scattered and uneven.

How to Set Up a Buffet (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Plan the food according to the season.,"Plan the food according to the season. The type of food we eat for meals often changes with the seasons. During summer, it feels tiring to eat a heavy meal filled with potatoes and meats. While during the winter, a light salad and lean fish may feel too light.[9] X Research source Fruits that contain a lot of water are great for summer buffets, like watermelon. Rich foods, like cheesy mash potatoes, are good for winter meals."
How to Set Up a Buffet (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Choose six to eight items.,"Choose six to eight items. You dont want to have too few or too many items to choose from. Too few items can leave some guests without food or choice if they dont like everything youve served. Too many choices may cause a more convoluted line with too much leftover food. Six to eight items is a good amount to give everyone enough choices. The serving size depends on the number of people you are expecting. You can send out a list of ideas for dishes and ask for feedback a week or two before the buffet. Be sure to have a variety of food. Don't have six or eight all-meat items. Include dishes with vegetables and grains in them as well. If you'll be serving meat, try to have two different choices, such as chicken and fish, rather than two chicken dishes."
How to Set Up a Buffet (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Line up the food according to temperature.,"Line up the food according to temperature. The first stop on the food line should be the hot foods. You want the guests to get to these first before they cool down too much. This way, your guests won't be dining on cold main courses when they find their seats. The cold foods should be at the end of the table. If possible, it is best to choose room temperature. Put out chafing dishes to keep foods hot, and ice platters to keep food cold."
How to Set Up a Buffet (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Arrange the food strategically.,"Arrange the food strategically. Put the cheapest and the food you have the most of at the beginning of the table. Put the most expensive and scarce food at the end of the table. It is a good idea to set it up this way because the food at the beginning of the table typically goes the fastest.[10] X Research source Consider switching foods during the course of the buffet. If the carrots arent being eaten enough, switch them out with a food that is going fast. Some foods become unappetizing the longer they sit. For example, if the salad is starting to look slimy or the casserole is congealing, switch it out! Try to add in a little variety if you're serving across multiple buffet tables.[11] X Expert Source Natasha MillerEvent Planner & CEO, Entire Productions Expert Interview. 20 April 2021."
How to Set Up a Buffet (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Add decorations.,"Add decorations. Once the table is set up, add decorations to amp up the appeal of the table. Dont choose anything that will get in the way or block people. Large candles on candlesticks may not be a good idea, but placing small ribbons or bows around the table wont get in the way of anyone reaching for food. If youre having a buffet for a holiday, choose decorations that correspond with that holiday. Saint Patricks Day decorations could be green, white, and gold. A Fourth of July buffet can be decked out in red, white, and blue. If you really want candles, consider LED or battery-operated candles instead. They last longer and you don't have to worry about fire hazards. Don't get too carried away with the decorations. A scatter of confetti is better than large ornaments and figures that take up too much space. If you want to have a statement decoration, consider putting it on a table that won't be frequented, such as the cake table or drinks table."
How to File a Lien: 14 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Exhaust all other options.,"Exhaust all other options. Filing a lien is a public declaration that someone hasn't paid for contract work, and is a strong legal move to make. Before you jump straight to the decision that you want to file a lien, talk to the property owner and attempt to set up another plan. Be clear from the beginning of a job that you'll file a lien if debts remain unpaid. Some states such as Washington have forms you can use to notify property owners of your right to file a lien if you aren't paid. You also can advise a property owner of your right to file a lien in your contract for the work. If the property owner agrees to a payment plan, make sure it has a reasonable due date and get the plan in writing. For example, if you completed some work on your client's garage for $2,000, you may work out a payment plan in which your client agrees to pay you $500 a month for the next four months. You may want to hire a lawyer at this point to help you draw up an agreement. You also might consider using alternative dispute resolution. With ADR, you and your client share the cost of hiring a neutral mediator who helps you work out a mutually agreeable outcome. The process often is less adversarial, more efficient and less expensive than filing a lien.[3] X Research source Your local courthouse or your state court's website may have a list of ADR resources available in your area. Hiring a debt collection agency is another way to avoid the time and expense of engaging in formal legal processes by filing a mechanic's lien. Debt collections agencies specialize in recovering debts and can put the pressure on your client without you having to take legal action. If you decide to go this route, research and find a collection agency that has a good reputation and specializes in working with people who do the same kind of work you do.[4] X Research source"
How to File a Lien: 14 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Make sure you've given preliminary notice.,"Make sure you've given preliminary notice. Most states require you to notify the debtor that you will file a lien if he doesn't pay you. Typically you would give this notice within the first few weeks of work, before payment even becomes a problem. If you fail to give preliminary notice, you may lose your right to file a lien if your client doesn't pay.[5] X Research source Some states require that you use a specific form to provide notice. Check with your local clerk of court's office to find out if your state has any specific requirements. In most states, preliminary notice must be given within 10 to 20 days of the date you began work.[6] X Research source"
How to File a Lien: 14 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Check your state's deadlines for filing a lien.,"Check your state's deadlines for filing a lien. You only have a brief period of time after you've completed the work to file for a lien, and in some states this period is as short as 60 days.[7] X Research source Depending on where you live, you may not have time to exhaust all other options before you file a lien if you want to preserve this option. For example, in Louisiana you only have 60 days from the day you finish the work to file a lien for non-payment. This doesn't give you much time to pursue alternative methods of collection. However, in neighboring Mississippi, you have a whole year from the date the debt became due. That gives you plenty of time to explore other payment options with your client.[8] X Research source"
How to File a Lien: 14 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Research the property.,"Research the property. To file a lien on property, you must conduct a title search on the property to ensure your client owns it and get the full legal description from the deed. This process could cost several hundred dollars to complete.[9] X Research source In some states such as Illinois, general contractors who file a lien before the deadline have priority over any other encumbrances on the property, even if another mortgage or a competing lien came first.[10] X Research source Other liens on property that would take priority over yours could mean that even if you filed suit and had the property sold, you wouldn't recover any money and the debt would remain unpaid.[11] X Research source If there are other creditors who have liens on the property, you should consider consulting an attorney to advise you on how those loans are prioritized legally and whether you should pursue alternative means of collection.[12] X Research source"
How to File a Lien: 14 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Draw up your lien.,"Draw up your lien. A lien typically is a one-page document with information about the creditor, the debtor, and the property. Most states have specific court forms to fill out. For example, California requires a Claim of Lien form as well as a notice and an affidavit.[13] X Research source You can learn your state's requirements by contacting your local clerk of court. Check the formatting requirements of the county where you're filing the lien, because many counties have strict rules governing the paper size, margins, and font of the text. If you don't follow these rules, the office will reject your lien.[14] X Research source The type of information required on the lien also varies from state to state, but typically includes your name and address, the name and address of your client, the amount of money you are owed, a description of the type of work or services you performed, and the location of the property. [15] X Research source Make sure you've included all necessary information or your lien won't be any good. For example, if you're placing a lien on real property, most states require a legal property description such as the one on the deed, not just a street address.[16] X Research source"
How to File a Lien: 14 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,File your lien.,"File your lien. Your lien must be filed with either the property recorder's office or the clerk of court. Each state designates a specific office to accept filings of mechanic's liens, so make sure you've got the right office. If you're claiming a lien on real property, it must be filed in the recorder's office of the county where the property is located.[17] X Research source Expect to pay a filing fee between $25 and $50 depending on the location where you file.[18] X Research source Although you often can file your lien by mailing it to the office, you may want to deliver it in person. Many offices have a backlog on mailed filings, so this is particularly important if you're filing close to the deadline. Additionally, filing in person means if there's something wrong with your lien you can find that out and correct it immediately.[19] X Research source"
How to File a Lien: 14 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Notify all necessary parties.,"Notify all necessary parties. In most states you must notify the property owner immediately after you file the lien. Some states require additional parties, such as other lien holders, to be notified as well. You can find out who must be notified when you file the lien.[20] X Research source In many cases, the property owner will make arrangements to pay the debt soon after receiving notice that you filed a lien."
How to File a Lien: 14 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Enforce your lien.,"Enforce your lien. If the debtor still doesn't pay after you've filed the lien, you must enforce the lien by filing a foreclosure lawsuit within a certain amount of time, usually a year.[21] X Research source The foreclosure suit causes the property to be sold. The proceeds of the sale are used to satisfy any liens on the property.[22] X Research source Make sure you check your state law to see what your enforcement period is. After the enforcement period runs out your lien is expired and has no value. Some states have extremely short enforcement periods. For example, in California you have just 90 days to file a lawsuit after filing your lien.[23] X Research source Because filing a foreclosure suit involves filing a formal complaint in court and following the court's rules, you should consider hiring an attorney who specializes in foreclosures or in enforcing mechanic's liens."
How to File a Lien: 14 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Understand whether you're eligible to file a judgment lien.,"Understand whether you're eligible to file a judgment lien. You can only file a judgment lien after you've won a court judgment in a case in civil court. The judgment lien allows you to sell the real or personal property subject to the lien and use that money to satisfy the debt owed to you.[24] X Research source A judgment lien does not ensure payment of a judgment. The lien attaches to the debtor's real or personal property, informing potential buyers that the title of the property is not clear. If you place a judgment lien on someone's property, there's a chance you won't receive your money until that person decides to sell that property."
How to File a Lien: 14 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Learn the rules for judgment liens in your state.,"Learn the rules for judgment liens in your state. Different states have different procedures for getting judgment liens and for maintaining them. If you aren't familiar with those rules you could cause your lien to expire. Generally, you can only place a lien on personal property located in the state where the judgment was obtained. The lien is only good for a certain period of time. For example, in states such as California and Arizona, your lien is good for five years, but may be renewed if you haven't been paid within that time.[25] X Research source If the debtor sells or transfers the property while the lien is in effect, the judgment lien remains on the property until the creditor has been paid in full."
How to File a Lien: 14 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Draft the relevant documents.,"Draft the relevant documents. If you're eligible to file a judgment lien, find out what documents you need to file, where you need to file them, and what fees will be charged. Some states have a form you can fill out. For example, if you want to file a lien in California on personal property such as a car or a boat, you would fill out a ""Notice of Judgment Lien, Form JL-1"" and file it with the California secretary of state.[26] X Research source If you wanted to place a lien on real property, on the other hand, you would fill out and record an ""Abstract of Judgment for Civil and Small Claims"" form at the county recorder's office.[27] X Research source In some states, such as Arizona, your lien must be accompanied by a certified copy of your court judgment. You can get a certified copy for a fee from the clerk's office in the court where you were awarded the judgment.[28] X Research source"
How to File a Lien: 14 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,File your documents.,"File your documents. Where you file your documents depends on where the property is located and whether you're attaching your lien to real or personal property. Each state has different filing rules, and the same state may have separate offices and procedures for real and personal property.[29] X Research source Typically you can mail your documents to the correct office along with the fee to file them, but as with the mechanic's lien it may be in your best interest to file them in person so you know the lien is recorded and you can correct any defects in your forms immediately.[30] X Research source"
How to File a Lien: 14 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Wait for the debtor to satisfy the judgment.,"Wait for the debtor to satisfy the judgment. A judgement lien does not guarantee payment of the debt. Rather, you have to wait until the debtor sells the property. If the buyer wants a clear title, she will insist the debtor satisfy the judgment before she completes her purchase. While there's no law that requires liens to be cleared before property is sold, in most cases potential buyers want a clear title, not a property that's encumbered with someone else's debts.[31] X Research source In some states such as California, if the debtor pays the judgment, you must remove the lien by filing a form with the court that acknowledges satisfaction of the judgment.[32] X Research source"
How to File a Lien: 14 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow,Pursue other options to recover the debt.,"Pursue other options to recover the debt.

How to Treat Breathing Problems in French Bulldogs: 13 Steps,Pay attention to breathing noises.,"Pay attention to breathing noises. Many of the snorts and snores that French bulldog owners take for granted are actually symptoms of their breathing distress. These signs include heavy panting, even at rest, and snoring when the dog is asleep. A dog that can breathe easily should not make much noise at all. If it sounds like your dog is struggling to breathe, especially when it has not been doing a lot of exercise, that is not normal and the dog should be looked at by a vet. A dog with breathing problems may also make choking sounds when over excited, and struggle to exercise in hot weather."
How to Treat Breathing Problems in French Bulldogs: 13 Steps,Be alert.,"Be alert. When exercising, the dog's breathing noises may become more exaggerated and more desperate. The dog may even drool heavily, rather than take time out from breathing to swallow.[4] X Research source This is a clear sign that your dog needs a break. It may not want to take one but it is your job to make it take a break until its breathing recovers."
How to Treat Breathing Problems in French Bulldogs: 13 Steps,Look for signs of oxygen deficiency.,"Look for signs of oxygen deficiency. In extreme cases, the dog may not be able to get enough oxygen to oxygenate its blood. This will result in its gums and tongue turning blue. [5] X Research source Complete collapse and loss of consciousness is not unheard of when French bulldogs are over exerted and lacking oxygen, especially in hot weather. To avoid this, try not to over exert your French bulldog on hot days or at all if you know they are already having problems breathing. If you see these symptoms, you should take your dog to a veterinarian immediately. A veterinarian will be able to give the dog emergency oxygen."
How to Treat Breathing Problems in French Bulldogs: 13 Steps,Understand breathing problems.,"Understand breathing problems. To understand treatment, it's helpful to understand the problem the French bulldog faces. Selective breeding for the flat face has created anatomical problems that make it difficult for these dogs to breathe. Many of these problems are due to the reduced size of the bony cavity of the nose while soft tissue structures, such as the tongue and soft palate, remain the same size. In the French bulldog's case this means his tongue and soft palate take up too much room and literally choke. Added to this, there are other anatomical problems. The French bulldog has unnaturally narrow nostrils. This makes it difficult for it to draw air in through its nose. This is one reason why the breed pant a lot, because they need to breathe through their mouth.[6] X Trustworthy Source American College of Veterinary Surgeons Trade organization responsible for setting standards of surgical excellence for the field of veterinary medicine and promoting safe practices for equine care. Go to source The tongue did not shrink back at the same time the nose shortened, so a large tongue has to fit into a smaller space.

How to Treat Breathing Problems in French Bulldogs: 13 Steps,Keep your French bulldog out of the heat.,"Keep your French bulldog out of the heat. Be aware that the French bulldog will struggle to breathe more than other breeds in hot weather, as it is already panting hard just to breathe.[8] X Research source It is essential to keep the dog cool in hot weather and not exercise it in the heat of the day. Make sure your French bulldog always has access to shade. It should never be left out in full sun. Keeping a French bulldog tied up in the sun can overheat it really quickly, even if it is not exercising.[9] X Research source If you know the day is going to be hot, consider keeping your dog in an air conditioned space."
How to Treat Breathing Problems in French Bulldogs: 13 Steps,Give your dog exercise breaks.,"Give your dog exercise breaks. When going for walks, let your dog stop and rest frequently.

How to Treat Breathing Problems in French Bulldogs: 13 Steps,Learn about your dog's breathing.,"Learn about your dog's breathing. With Brachycephalic airway syndrome, the bony chamber of the nose is physically smaller but the soft palate that separates the back of the nose from the throat remains the same size. This is like having a curtain that's too long for a window in place. As the dog breathes in, the pressure change tends to suck the soft palate against the entrance to the trachea (windpipe), blocking it off.[10] X Trustworthy Source American College of Veterinary Surgeons Trade organization responsible for setting standards of surgical excellence for the field of veterinary medicine and promoting safe practices for equine care. Go to source This causes the French bulldog to choke and gasp for breath. Laryngeal saccules also affect breathing. These are tonsil like tissue located just inside the larynx (voice box). Changes in air pressure created by the anatomical changes have the effect of sucking the laryngeal saccules in the way of the trachea, and block it. Also, a hypoplastic trachea impacts breathing. The windpipe of French bulldogs can be much narrower than a normal windpipe. This produces increased resistance to airflow and yet more breathing problems.[11] X Trustworthy Source American College of Veterinary Surgeons Trade organization responsible for setting standards of surgical excellence for the field of veterinary medicine and promoting safe practices for equine care.

Then, for a coffin nail, file perpendicular at the very tip to create that squared end. For squared nails, though, start filing perpendicular to the tip until you have a flat end, then only file the outside edges slightly to smooth them out.[8] X Research source As you work on rounded shapes, alternate filing either side of the nail to ensure a smooth and symmetrical curve. For example, file 10 strokes on one side, and 10 strokes on the other. For stiletto nails, focus only on filing the sides of the nail into straight lines that meet at the end. Then, file down the very tip to make it slightly blunt, so you dont accidentally cause injuries."

Look for information from government publications or reputable news sources. Use caution when doing online research. Beware of any website that seems to push an overtly pro-choice or pro-life agenda. Know that abortion is safe. Only one percent of abortions have complications.[5] X Research source Know that abortions will not cause breast cancer. Additionally, an uncomplicated abortion will not cause infertility or trouble for future pregnancies.[6] X Research source Abortion will not cause post-abortion syndrome or other mental health issues. It is, however, a stressful event, and some women find themselves having a more difficult time following the abortion, due to preexisting mental health conditions or a lack of a support network, for example.[7] X Research source"
How to Decide Whether or Not to Get an Abortion: 12 Steps,Determine if you are eligible for a medical abortion.,"Determine if you are eligible for a medical abortion. Medical, or non-surgical abortions, can be done up to ten weeks (70 days) from the first day of the womans last period. Your healthcare provider will perform a physical exam, usually including an ultrasound, and then prescribe mifepristone (or sometimes methotrexate) and misoprostol.[8] X Research source If you are able and willing to pursue a medical abortion, you will first take the mifepristone, which blocks your bodys production of progesterone, a hormone necessary for pregnancy. After 24-48 hours, you will take the misoprostol, which causes the uterus to empty. You will have cramps and heavy bleeding, usually within 4-5 hours of taking the medication. Once this is complete, you will need to see your doctor to make sure your body has expelled all of the tissue. Follow-up is absolutely necessary, to ensure that the pregnancy was successfully expelled. Failure to expel the pregnancy completely could lead to serious complications and infection.[9] X Research source The benefits of a medical abortion are that it can be done at home, and can be done early in the pregnancy (as soon as you know you are pregnant). However, there are also risks of the abortion being incomplete. If it is, then you would likely need a surgical abortion.[10] X Research source"
How to Decide Whether or Not to Get an Abortion: 12 Steps,Research a surgical abortion.,"Research a surgical abortion. A surgical abortion, also known as suction aspiration abortion, can be performed if you are under 14-16 weeks pregnant (this may vary by provider). The procedure involves dilating the cervix and inserting a small suction tube into the uterus to remove the pregnancy tissue.[11] X Trustworthy Source University of California San Francisco Health Center Research hospital associated with UCSF, a leading medical university, providing innovative patient care and public health resources Go to source The actual aspiration, or abortion procedure, takes only a few minutes. Most of the time spent in the clinic or doctors office will be spent waiting for pain/relaxation medication to begin to work, as well as dilating your cervix to create an opening large enough for the suction tube to fit through. Your cervix may be dilated with metal rods of increasing thickness, medication, or dilators that expand through fluid absorption.[12] X Research source You will spend at least an hour in recovery to ensure there were no immediate complications from your procedure. You may be asked to schedule an additional follow-up appointment. If you are over 16 weeks pregnant, you will have a procedure known as a dilation and evacuation (D&E). This is similar to the aspiration abortion, though it requires more time and equipment. You will likely have a slower recovery than with an aspiration abortion.[13] X Research source"
How to Decide Whether or Not to Get an Abortion: 12 Steps,Examine your current situation.,"Examine your current situation. As you consider what to do about your pregnancy, think about what is currently going on in your life and consider how a pregnancy or baby would impact it. You may want to spend some time thinking through some issues on your own. Consider your financial situation. Are you able to afford having a baby and raising it? Think about your personal beliefs about abortion. If you do not feel comfortable with abortion, would you consider putting the baby up for adoption? Think about your health. Would being pregnant be harmful to your body or mental state? Would you be able to handle the emotional and physical impact of having an abortion? Think about your support network. Who would help you raise the child? Would the babys father be involved? If you had an abortion, who could be there to support you?[14] X Research source"
How to Decide Whether or Not to Get an Abortion: 12 Steps,Discuss your feelings with others.,"Discuss your feelings with others. Talk to your partner, loved ones, or friends who you know wont judge or influence your decision. Many women feel alone when dealing with an unwanted pregnancy. Talking to trustworthy members of your support network may help you feel less isolated.[15] X Research source If the father is present and involved in your life, you may wish to speak to him about what he would like to do. Remember, you do not need his permission to get an abortion. If you feel he may pressure you one way or another, however, you may wish to avoid telling him. Dont let anyone pressure your decision. If your friend says something like, If you have an abortion I wont be able to be friends with you anymore, because I believe abortion is wrong, you could say, Im sorry you feel that way, but please dont put pressure on me. I need to do what is best for me. Talk to someone who has had an abortion. If you know of anyone who has had an abortion, ask what their experience was like, and how they look back on it positively or negatively. You could ask, Are you comfortable talking about your abortion? Could I ask you a few questions about it? Im pregnant and Im not sure what to do."

Your doctor, family planning clinic, or community health agency may know of counseling services that can help you decide what to do. Make sure the resources they give you are unbiased, nonjudgmental counseling services that do not attempt to push the woman toward one option or another. Do your research on any names or agencies you receive to make sure they are unbiased. Look for any affiliations that may seem questionable to you (political or religious). Understand that any reputable agency or counselor will help you explore all your options without judgement or coercion. If you feel pressured into making a particular decision, find someone else to talk to.[16] X Research source"
How to Decide Whether or Not to Get an Abortion: 12 Steps,Make a timely decision.,"Make a timely decision. If you are considering abortion, you do need to make a decision as quickly as possible. While you want to be certain of your decision, also understand that the earlier in the pregnancy you decide to terminate it, the easier your procedure will likely be. You will also have more options available. In most states in United States, you cannot get an abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy, unless the pregnancy is a risk to the mothers health.[17] X Research source"
How to Decide Whether or Not to Get an Abortion: 12 Steps,Make a list.,"Make a list.

You may want to weigh all three options (parenting, abortion, or adoption) or just two if you know you are not ready to be a parent, for example."
How to Decide Whether or Not to Get an Abortion: 12 Steps,Take the next steps.,"Take the next steps. Once you have made your decision, take your next steps quickly. If you are choosing to continue with the pregnancy, you will still want to follow up for prenatal care as soon as possible. If you decide to have an abortion, schedule it as soon as you can. Keep in mind that you may need to travel to a clinic, and factor in some states mandatory waiting periods as well. Consider any financial needs you may have in order to pay for the abortion. If you are planning to continue the pregnancy, be sure that you are not smoking, drinking, or using drugs, eating well, and are taking a prenatal vitamin that includes folic acid -- a necessary nutrient for a developing fetus.[18] X Research source"

If you decide to have an abortion, you may be able to have an IUD (intrauterine device) inserted at the time of your abortion procedure. Check with your doctor about this option. While it prevents pregnancy, it does not protect against sexually transmitted infections.[19] X Research source If you have a regular sex partner, discuss with them what protection youd both like to take going forward."

Expert Advice on How to Get Stronger and Thicker Wrists - wikiHow,Practice wrist extensions.,"Practice wrist extensions. Wrist extensions are an easy exercise that you can start doing at home to increase flexibility in the forearm muscles that power your wrist. Doing wrist extensions is the best way to gradually start getting bigger wrists. Rest the back of your forearm on a table or on your leg. Your palm should be facing up, and your hand should be aligned with your arm. Place a light weight in that hand, then slowly lower the weight toward the floor.

Tilt the dumbbell toward the ceiling and slowly lower it down. Do two sets of 10 or 15 reps with each wrist four or five times a week."

Expert Advice on How to Get Stronger and Thicker Wrists - wikiHow,Stretch out your wrists.,"Stretch out your wrists. Doing wrist stretches is an important part of working up to any strength training routine that you want to integrate into your overall fitness. Especially if you've got small or ""weak"" wrists, it's a good idea to stretch things out before you get started. Get on your hands and knees and place your hands flat on the ground with your fingers pointing back toward your body. Keep your arms straight and locked and stretch your wrists gently. Don't force them. Count to fifteen. When you get comfortable with that stretch, try to extend your legs out behind you and bring your hips down to the ground while pushing your torso up by fully extending your arms with your palms flat on the floor. In yoga, this is called the ""cobra pose"" and it can be very effective at stretching your wrists."
Expert Advice on How to Get Stronger and Thicker Wrists - wikiHow,Be patient,"Be patient. Building strength takes time, which means you need to be patient.

Expert Advice on How to Get Stronger and Thicker Wrists - wikiHow,Do curls with a straight bar and a fat bar.,"Do curls with a straight bar and a fat bar. Bicep curls obviously target the biceps, primarily, but you can also use curls as a chance to strengthen your forearms as well. Basic bicep curls require you to keep your wrists straight, which helps to build strength while you're doing the exercise, but you can also mix it up and do some wrist curls with both the fat bar and the straight bar to increase hand strength and wrist strength. Grip the bar over hand, with less weight than you'd use for a bicep curl. At the curl station, instead of bringing the bar all the way up as you would in a bicep curl, flex your wrists to bring the bar up. Do the same number of sets and reps you use for bicep curls. Repeat the exercise with an under-hand grip as well."
Expert Advice on How to Get Stronger and Thicker Wrists - wikiHow,Do plate pinches.,"Do plate pinches.

It couldn't be an easier exercise, provided you've got some heavy stuff to lift.[2] X Research source Line up one or two plates from the weight machine on the ground, perpendicular with the ground. Squat down, gripping them with your hands, then stand up, holding it securely. That's it. Alternate hands, doing three sets of five-ten reps, or whatever is comfortable for you. You could also use a stack of a few heavy books, something that will stretch out your grip and force you to spread your fingers relatively wide as you lift. It's mostly about the strength required to grip the objects together."
Expert Advice on How to Get Stronger and Thicker Wrists - wikiHow,Do wrist rollers.,"Do wrist rollers. Wrist rollers require a special device called a wrist roller, but this is commonly available at most gyms, and you could also bootleg one in a pinch. The exercise itself is simple, but challenging, extremely effective at building forearm strength and bigger wrists. A wrist roller bar is basically a short bar with a rope in the center, from which a weight hangs. If you don't have one, you could also use a bar from a barbell, hanging one of the weights from it with a length of rope, about 24 inches (61.0 cm) long.[3] X Research source Grip the bar with both hands, palms facing down and extend your arms straight out in front of you. As the weight hangs, twist the bar up and backward with your wrists, one at a time, as if you were activating the gas on a motorcycle. Try 10 or 15 reps at three sets."

If you want to work on stability and strength in your forearms, doing push-ups is a great way of exercising. Traditional, flat-handed pushups, though, can actually stress your wrists, causing soreness and stiffness in the joint. Instead, use push-ups as an opportunity to build strength in your wrists by doing them on your knuckles instead of your flat palms. Focus on keeping your wrists very straight and solid while you do push-ups, however many you're comfortable doing. If you're just getting started, try doing three sets of ten."
Expert Advice on How to Get Stronger and Thicker Wrists - wikiHow,Avoid the use of wrist straps.,"Avoid the use of wrist straps.
